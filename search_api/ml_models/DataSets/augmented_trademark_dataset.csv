Versus
TRISA BURSTENFABRIK AG TRIENGEN and another---Respondents
","Civil Petition No. 1496-K of 2021, decided on 27th April, 2023.
(Against judgment dated 15.7.2021 passed by the High Court of Sindh at Karachi in M.A. No. 10 of 2004)
","27th April, 2023.","MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR, J.","According to the chronicles of the subject matter, the petitioner has been a manufacturer of tooth brushes and hair brushes in Pakistan since 1983 and allegedly improved and enhanced the quality of its products and now holds a position in the market with the trade mark ""TRISA"" in Class No. 21 under Trade Mark No. 86913 which was registered on 14.07.1985 for tooth brushes, nail brushes, shaving brushes and hair brushes. It is further alleged that the respondent No.1 has no right to the petitioner's registered trade mark but it was trying to usurp the trade mark ""TRISA"". Due to such illegal actions, the petitioner filed Civil Suit No.863/1997 in the Sindh High Court and obtained an injunctive order on 10.03.1999 against which the respondent No.1 preferred H.C.A. No. 83/1999, however the HCA was disposed off by consent on 09.08.2005 without modifying or setting aside the aforesaid injunctive order. The respondent No. 1 filed an application for registration of trade mark in Class-21 in respect of household or kitchen utensils and other articles including brushes (except paint brushes). According to section 15(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 read with Rule 30 of the Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963, (""Revised Rules 1963""), a time-limit of two months is prescribed for filing opposition (Form TM-55) from the date of publication of advertisement in the Trade Mark Journal. The petitioner sought time to file TM-55 i.e. opposition to the registration of the respondent No.1's alleged trademark, and the Registrar of Trade Marks, after hearing the petitioner and the respondent No.1, passed a decision on 18.08.2003 allowing the petitioner's request for extension of time to file opposition and condoned the delay of 108 days. The respondent No. 1 challenged the aforesaid decision in the High Court by dint of M.A. No. 10/2004 and vide the impugned judgment the appeal was allowed and the decision dated 18.08.2003 passed by the Registrar, Trade Marks was set aside.","The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the impugned judgment has been passed without appreciating the law and the rules applicable. It was further averred that the learned Single Judge failed to consider that there is no vested right in procedure. He further contended that the decision of Registrar was based on the premise that the petitioner was never issued or received a notice prior to the publication of the respondent No.1's application as the search was not carried out properly under Rule 23 of the Revised Rules, 1963. It was further avowed that it is a settled rule of interpretation that no one has a vested right in procedure, coupled with the principle that, since no penal consequences have been prescribed in Rule 30 of the Revised Rules 1963, the same cannot be treated as mandatory. It was submitted that the use of the word ""shall"" does not make Rule 30 mandatory or the time prescribed therein unimpeachable, more so when Rule 76 of the Revised Rules 1963 grant a special jurisdiction to the Registrar of Trade Marks to extend time for doing any act or taking any proceeding under the Revised Rules 1963, subject to satisfaction of the Registrar on proper justification. He further contended that the learned Single Judge failed to appreciate that the Registrar of Trade Marks could exercise his authority based on objective criteria at his discretion and satisfaction and the facts of this case fully justified the grant of extension.","Heard the arguments. There is no dispute or disagreement between the parties that all four separate requests for extension of time (TM-55) were sent on same date (i.e. on 11.3.2003) and were late by 108 days. The Registrar Trade Marks condoned the delay of 108 days and the Notice of opposition (TM-55) was brought on record. According to section 15 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, opposition to the registration of a trade mark may be filed when an application for registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, and the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted to be advertised in the prescribed manner, and compliant with sub section (2), any person may, within the prescribed time from the date of advertisement of an application, give notice in writing in the prescribed manner to the Registrar for opposition to the registration and, in line with subsection (3), the Registrar is obligated to serve a copy of the notice on the applicant in the prescribed manner, and, within the prescribed time, the applicant shall send to the Registrar, in the prescribed manner, a counter-statement of the grounds on which he relies for his application and, if he does not do so, he shall be deemed to have abandoned his application.","The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 argued that the application for registration of the Trade Mark was submitted on 23.04.1997 after complying with all requisite formalities advertised in Trade Mark Journal No.598 for the month of November 2000, so any person could oppose the registration by filing a notice of opposition within the stipulated period of two months from the date of advertisement as provided in the Revised Rules 1963, but no opposition was filed till 10.03.2003 despite the fact that the statutory period of two months expired on 22.11.2002 and no request for extension was filed by the petitioner. However, on 11.03.2003, the petitioner at one time filed four applications for extension in time which were heard by the Registrar together and, after the hearing, the Registrar Trade Marks through decision dated 18.08.2003 condoned the delay of 108 days without any lawful justification and said action was in violation of the powers vested in the Registrar for exercising the discretion of granting an extension of time which should have been based on concrete and justifiable grounds rather than in a slipshod manner. The learned counsel further argued that the learned High Court has considered all the aspects of the case in a proper manner and rightly set aside the decision of Registrar which was based on an incorrect exposition of law.","In view of the above discussion, we do not find any illegality or perversity in the impugned judgment passed by the learned Sindh High Court. Consequently, this petition is dismissed and leave is refused.",Dismissed.

Versus
K&N'S FOODS (PVT.) LIMITED and others---Respondents
","Civil Appeals Nos. 444 and 445 of 2017, decided on 10th May, 2023.
(Against the judgment of the Competition Appellate Tribunal, Islamabad, dated 25.01.2017, passed in Appeal No. 03 of 2016).
",25.01.2017,"SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, J.","Briefly, the facts of the case are that K&N's Foods (Pvt) Limited (""K&N's Foods"") filed a complaint against A. Rahim Foods (Pvt) Limited (""Rahim Foods"") with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (""Commission""), asserting involvement of Rahim Foods in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act. In the complaint, K&N's Foods mainly alleged that Rahim Foods was copying the K&N's Foods product labelling and packaging for the sale of its several frozen and processed meat products. It also alleged copying of its trademark term ""Combo Wings"" by Rahim Foods for one of the products, that is, the chicken wings. Two officers of the Commission, under the delegated powers, conducted an enquiry into the matter complained of. After collecting and considering the respective evidence of the parties, the enquiry officers submitted their report confirming the allegations and proposing the initiation of proceedings against Rahim Foods under Section 30 of the Act.","(A) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging is misleadingly similar to that of the Complainant's K&N Packing and if so, whether such confusing resemblance is deceptive and amounts to ""fraudulent use of another's ..product labelling or packaging"" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(B) Whether the use of the term/mark 'Combo Wings' by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], in the absence of authorization from the Complainant [K&N's Foods], amounts to """"fraudulent use of another's trademark..."" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(C) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging and/or use of the mark 'Combo Wings' amount to the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interest"" of the Complainant [K&N's Foods] within the meaning andPLD
 scope of Section 10(2)(a) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.","Pursuant to its findings on the said issues, the Commission imposed the following penalties on Rahim Foods for contravention of the provisions of section 10, under section 38 of the Act:
i. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
ii. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
In the exercise of its powers under section 31(c) of the Act, the Commission further directed Rahim Foods to cease the use of the contentious copycat packaging for its frozen and processed meat products and to ensure that the products were repackaged in a manner that was distinct in its overall layout so as to be easily distinguishable from that of the K&N's Foods products.
","the Commission observed that as the trademark ""Combo Wings"" had not been registered at the time of lodging of the complaint by K&N's Foods, its use by Rahim Foods did not constitute a contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act, but decided this issue in affirmative with the following observations:
However, the use of the term ""Combo Wings"" by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], when seen in conjunction with the overall layout and design of the copied and duplicated K&N Packaging, demonstrates the Respondent's intention to pass off its products as those of the Complainant [K&N's Foods]. To such extent only, and as part of its overall scheme of deception, the use of the term in question falls within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, as fraudulent use of another's product labelling.
The Commission and the Tribunal both have also concurred on the point that the above facts fall within the prohibition of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(d) though they have differed on the applicability of Section 10(2)(a) of the Act. They have also expressed divergent views on the requirement of registration of a trademark to attract the provisions of Section 10(2)(d) for ""fraudulent use of another's trademark"".",The appeal filed by the Commission in the present case against the decision of the Tribunal setting aside partially its quasi-judicial order is therefore not maintainable.,Dismissed

EAST RICE COMPANY (PVT.) LTD. and others---Plaintiffs
Versus
MOON RICE CORPORATION and others---Defendants
","Suit No. 471 of 2022, decided on 19th July, 2022.","5th 14th and 25th April, 2022.","MUHAMMAD FAISAL KAMAL ALAM, J.","Relevant facts for deciding this Injunction Application is that Plaintiffs are exporters of Rice to over forty countries worldwide, including Federal Republic of Somalia. Plaintiffs own and operate a state of the art equipment and rice milling equipment: besides, Plaintiff No.1 possesses highest capacity for parboiling Basmati Rice, whereas, Plaintiff No.2 also has presence in Dubai. United Arab Emirates (""UAE""): Plaintiff No.3 has received the Presidential Award for highest export of Pakistani Basmati Rice to various countries around the globe.
Averred that up till 07.03.2022. Plaintiffs have been exporting 'PK-386 Long Grain Rice' with the package livery stating 'HAMZA' (in a green ellipse. coupled with paddy leaves). Collectively Plaintiffs have a considerable market share in the Somalian market.
on 07.03.2022 a Public Notice was published, whereby, Defendant No.1 caused for the threatening of legal consequences against exporters of rice, whose package livery shall bear the 'Hamza' in a green ellipse, coupled with paddy leaves; this Public Notice published in the daily 'Nawa-e-Waqt' is appended as Annexure 'F' of the plaint, at page-2263.","Legal team of Plaintiffs argued that upon investigation, it was found that the Subject Mark bearing No.500595 in Class-30 was registered on 07.12.2021, besides, Defendant No.1 also fraudulently obtained registration under the category of 'Artistic Work' bearing Registration No.44834-COPR on 04.02.2022, given by the Defendant No.3 (Copyright Office Karachi - Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan). Sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law have been referred to fortify the arguments that the impugned registration granted by official Defendants Nos.2 and 3 is in violation of these provisions and results in unfair competition, as Defendant No.1 has ousted the Plaintiffs from the export of subject rice to other countries, particularly, Somalia. The afore referred public notice was in fact a threat of infringement proceeding, against which the present Lis is filed and the record appended with the plaint, inter alia, relating to the exports of Plaintiff shows that both the Official Defendants Nos.2 and 3 have wrongly registered the mark so also the logo","In view of the above discussion, I am afraid, basic ingredients for grant of an injunctive relief are not present in the case of Plaintiffs, as admittedly, it is the Defendant No. 1, which is the holder of a Registered Trade Mark and not Plaintiffs. Consequently, injunction application [C.M.A. No.5259 of 2022] is dismissed.
12. Defendant No.1 is further directed to maintain proper accounts of its business activities and, particularly, relating to exports, from the date of registration of the Impugned Trademark till the pendency of present Lis and the same should be furnished/filed monthly, under the Statement of learned Advocate for Defendant No.1. In this regard the Office will make a separate File for keeping the record of above Accounts.","The contention of Plaintiffs, that 'HAMZA' is a common trademark used by different entities, including Plaintiffs, hence, it should not have been registered is considered in the light of case law cited by both learned Advocates for Plaintiffs and private Defendant No.1. None of the cited decisions has determined this crucial point that if a person or an entity has a registered trademark in its favour, even then he or the said entity would not be entitled for its exclusive use, on the basis of 'publici juris'. The case law relied upon by Plaintiffs' legal team, in particular, the reported Decisions handed down in Master case and Haico case (supra) though have discussed the concept of 'publici juris', but the injunction was not granted, primarily, considering the fact that in both cases the mark was not registered in favour of plaintiffs (of the reported cases). Adverting to the second contention of Plaintiffs, about applicability of sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law. In this regard judgment handed down by learned Division Bench of this Court in Dalda Foods (ibid) is perused, wherein, inter alia, sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law are also discussed. Shield Corporation Limited/respondent (of the reported case) has obtained an injunctive order in the suit filed by it, against the appellant-Dalda Foods, restraining the latter from using the trademark 'Shield and Device of Shield'. Learned Division Bench has allowed the Appeal and set aside the injunction order, mainly, on the basis that use of the word 'health shield' by appellant - Dalda Foods on its product is neither a misrepresentation nor a deceptive tactic for confusing some unwary buyer. Conversely, situation here is opposite; admittedly, the trademark of Defendant No.1 has been registered, against which, as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, revocation proceeding has been initiated, which is sub judice.
Secondly, as per the official version, present Plaintiffs did not contest the proceeding before the Registrar when the trademark in question was in the process of registration.
Thirdly, the Certificate of Registration (impugned), appended with the Counter Affidavit of Defendant No.l dated 17.12.2021, bears a disclaimer, that registration of this trade mark shall give no right to the exclusive use of word ""HAMZA"" except substantially as shown on the label.
Fourthly, with the Counter Affidavit of Defendant No. 1, it has also attached the Copyright registration dated 4-2-2022, in the artistic work (Label Design) entitled ""HAMZA"".

KAMRAN AKHLAQ---Defendant
","Civil Suit No. 142 of 2012, decided on 15th September, 2022.",12.08.2021,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","The plaintiffs claim to be the first original creator, adopter, sole owner and exclusive right holder of a cartoon character named ""Dollar Mascot"" and its various forms and variation including colour scheme and artistic work therein since 2005, which cartoon character is extensively and continuously advertised since 2006, and by virtue of such a wide and extensive publicity, and sales made under the said copyrighted work, the said character has attained enviable reputation and goodwill. That in order to secure the proprietary rights in the said cartoon character, plaintiffs No.2 had filed applications for registration of copyright therein with the Copy Right Registry on 07.07.2011 on the basis of such longstanding use, to which none had filed any opposition or objections. That the plaintiffs came to know through the internet that the defendant in order to deceive and cause confusion amongst the buyers is displaying, uploading and offering for sale the same cartoon character and its various forms/modes through internet website www.fotolia.com. Plaintiffs thereafter issued legal notices to the defendant on 25.04.2011 and subsequently on 25.08.2011 requiring him to stop. The plaintiffs also complained the matter with the copyrights agent of Fotolia website and demanded the said website to expeditiously remove or disable access to such contents illegally displayed, offered for sale or free downloads and as a result of the notice dated 26.04.2011, Fotolia immediately removed the said cartoon character from its website. The matter came up in the Court on 09.02.2012, when notices were ordered to be issued to the defendant. Thereafter, office has issued summons to the defendant, which returned with an endorsement that defendant refused to accept it. Vakalatnama was filed by Khawaja Muhammad Azeem on behalf of the said defendant on 05.11.2012, therefore, the matter was taken up by the A.R (O.S) for filing of written statement by the defendant on 30.04.2013, 10.09.2013 and 28.01.2014 however none appeared on his behalf, hence A.R (O.S) debarred the defendant vide diary dated 18.02.2014. On 05.12.2014, the matter was fixed for final disposal and the plaintiffs were directed to file affidavit-in-ex-parte proof, which was filed accordingly. Plaintiffs filed application under Order XIII, rule 2, C.P.C. seeking permission for production of copyright registration certificate bearing Registration Nos.26519-Corp to 26532-Corp and Nos.26587-Corp to 26606-Corp (total 34 in number) dated 31.07.2012, which was allowed vide order dated 18.10.2017 and the plaintiffs were directed to file additional affidavit-in-evidence for exhibiting all the above mentioned registration certificates, which were filed accordingly and vide order dated 29.10.2018 office was directed to attach the same with the affidavit-in-ex parte proof and the matter was fixed for evidence. On 02.12.2019 he was again examined on additional affidavit-in-ex-parte proof and the matter was directed to be fixed for final arguments.","Issues posed through this Suit could be summarized as under:-
1. Whether there is copyright in a cartoon character?
2. Whether the plaintiffs had copyright in the said cartoon character?
3. Has the defendant infringed plaintiffs' copyright in the said cartoon character?
4. What the decree should be?

","Conclusion of the issue 1 discussion leads to the answering of this issue in the affirmative.
Residual effect of the above discussion is that the Plaintiffs have copyright in the said cartoon character, hence issue No.2 is answered in the affirmative.
Resultantly Issue No. 3 is answered in affirmative as there is no cavil that the defendant left any stone unturned to infringe the plaintiffs' copyrighted work and scheme of law fully supports the case of the plaintiffs.
With regard issue No.4, this Court reached to the conclusion that the plaintiffs were able to prove their case against the defendant.","Issues No.1 is heart of the matter which is primarily a legal issue regarding copyrightability of cartoon characters. It is worth noting that one of the most well-known cartoon charter of our times is Mickey Mouse (an animated mouse) which was originally created in October 1928. With regards infringement of cartoon characters, courts usually rely on the copyright protection in the original work, as it is usually difficult to copy a character without copying a substantial amount of the original author's expression. The 'substantial similarity test' is used for determining when enough has been taken from the original work so as to constitute infringement. The first step of the proposed test is whether a character is a general type, i.e. an idea, or whether the character is developed enough to constitute protectable expression. This part of the test is only a way of eliminating characters that are obviously of a general type with little expression so that a lengthy analysis would be unnecessary. The second part of the test is to apply the extrinsic/intrinsic test articulated in Krofft to determine if a character is protected by copyright within the context of the original work.""
the witness of the Plaintiffs has submitted a number of registration certificates of the said cartoon character as Exhibit P-1/76 to P-1/109 issued by the Copyright Registry proving that the said work after going through the scrutiny of the Copyright Ordinance and its Rules has already been registered as Artistic Work. The said witness also produced advertisement of plaintiffs cartoon character published in newspaper and magazines as Exhibits PW-1/12 to PW-1/30 and certified copies of the Copyright applications and their advertisements in the newspaper as Exhibit PW-1/31 to PW-1/65
To prove Issue No.2 as to the ownership of copyright in the work, the Plaintiff's witness namely Mr. Abdullah Feroz produced Copyright Registration Certificates Nos.26519-Corp to 26532-Corp and Nos.26587-Corp to 26606-Corp (total 34 in number) dated 31.07.2012 as Exhibit P-1/76 to P-1/109 issued by the Copyright Registry proving registration of the said artistic work with the Copyright Registry.
Section 42(2) titled ""Register of Copyrights to be prima facie evidence of particulars entered therein"" provides that a certificate of registration of copyright in a work shall be prima facie evidence that copyright subsists in the work and that the person shown in the certificate as the owner of the copyright is the owner of such copyright.
To prove issue No.3, the Plaintiffs' witness produced on record Appointment letter dated 01.09.2004 showing that the defendant was employed as Graphic Designer in Plaintiffs' company and affidavit/undertaking of Surrender and Non-Disclosure as Exhibits PW-1/10 and PW-1/11 are also on record.
The ""substantial similarity test"" is used for determining when enough has been taken from the original work so as to constitute infringement. The first step of the proposed test is whether a character is a general type, i.e. an idea, or whether the character is developed enough to constitute protectable expression. The second part of the test is to apply the extrinsic/intrinsic test articulated in Krofft7 to determine if a character is protected by copyright within the context of the original work.

SHEZAN BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS (PRIVATE) LIMITED and another---Respondents
","Civil Appeal No. 57-K of 2018, decided on 9th June, 2022.
(On appeal from the judgment dated 14.05.2018 of the High Court of Sindh, Karachi passed in Misc. Appeal No. 317 of 2003)
","9th February, 2022.","Qazi Faez Isa, J. ","Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on 13 August 2018 to consider the judgment dated 14 May 2018 of a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi (in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003), who had upheld the decision dated 25 June 2003 of the Registrar of the Trade Marks, the respondent 2 herein ('the Registrar') 
The respondent 1, Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Private) Limited, ('the respondent') is a registered private limited company and filed an application (No. 100857, dated 29 December 1988) with the Registrar to seek the registration of the trade mark 'Shezan' written in a particular manner ('the Application'). The application was eventually published in the Trade Marks Journal (No. 574, November 1998); an application to register a trade mark is published under subsection (1) of section 15 of the Act, and under subsection (2) of section 15 of the Act, 'any person may with the prescribed time from the date of the advertisement, give notice in writing in the prescribed manner to the Registrar, of opposition to the registration.' The Application sought registration of a trade mark in class 29 in respect of the following goods:
'All kinds of patties, cheese straw, chicken sandwiches, chicken spring rolls, vegetable spring rolls, fish rolls, fish kababs, pizza (mince), pizza (chicken), meat, fish, poultry and game; meat extracts preserved, dried and cooked fruits and vegetable; jellies, jams, eggs, milk and milk products; edible oils and fats, salad dressings; preserves, being goods included in class 29'.
Shahnawaz Limited was the owner/ proprietor of the word 'Shezan' and had it registered as a trademark in different classes, including in class 29 on 30 September 1958. It had also obtained registration of Shezan as a label mark with Shezan written in a particular manner. Shahnawaz Limited assigned its trade marks to Shezan International Limited, and Shezan International Limited assigned them to the appellant. All the trade marks have been kept renewed, and subsist till date.
The appellant, Shezan Services (Private) Limited), a private limited company, who was assigned the trade mark, opposed the Application as per prescribed form (TM-5) being Opposition No. 218/2001 ('the Opposition'). In the Opposition it was stated that the ownership/proprietorship of the word 'Shezan' and label Shezan vested in it and the respondent could not seek registration of an identical trade mark. In response to the Opposition, the respondent filed counter statement as per the prescribed form (TM-6).
","It appears that the parties had the business relationship under the agreement dated 19.2.1975 whereby goodwill of the Shezan Continental, the Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery was negotiated in terms of the agreement. It is urged that respondent No.1 in utter disregard to the spirit of the agreement dated 19.2.1975 applied for registration of mark SHEZAN label in Class 29 which was advertised in Trade Marks Journal on 1.11.1998 which was opposed. Application for registration for Mark 'SHEZAN' was allowed with certain conditionalities within the territory of Lahore and opposition filed by the petitioner was dismissed vide order dated 25.6.2003.
Order of the Registrar Trade Marks was impugned through Misc. Appeal No.317/2003 before the High Court. Learned Bench of the High Court, in consideration of the fact that goodwill in the business includes the Trade Mark 'Shezan' was parted away under the agreement noted above, therefore, the respondent No.1 is within its right to use subject Mark within the territorial limits of Lahore Division.
Learned counsel for the petitioner took us to various clauses of the preamble and Clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the agreement dated 19.2.1975 to urge that through various restrictive covenants prohibited the use of the word 'Shezan' either by prefixing or affixing the expression in any place in Pakistan. Per learned ASC for the Petitioner Respondent firm was allowed to carry on business subject matter of the agreement anywhere within the territorial limits of Lahore Division, without appropriating the Trade Mark 'Shezan'. Clause-4 prohibits use of the Mark in Lahore Division. It urged that it is the overall tenor of the agreement that is required to be taken into consideration rather than any clause in isolation. It is urged that the Registrar of Trade Mark and learned Bench of the High Court failed to determine the meaning of the goodwill which did not in any manner under the facts and circumstances of the case allowed approbation [sic] of the petitioner's Trademark either within or outside the Lahore Division. It is urged that the Registrar Trade Mark and learned High Court erred in interpreting Section 2(10) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 thus, erred in conceding to the claim of the respondent No. 1. Points noted above do raise question of the first impression. Accordingly, leave is granted to consider such aspect of the matter.'
","NOW THEREFORE the parties to the agreement mutually agreed as under:
1) The firm will have the right to continue the business of running restaurants at the premises known as 46-Dingah Singh Building, Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore and 7- Dayal Singh Menions, Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore, under the respective names of Shezan (Lahore) Continental and Shezan (Lahore) Oriental and at such other places where the firm may deem fit within the territorial limits of Lahore Division only along with the business of Bakery under the name of Shezan (Lahore) Bakery. The firm will not use the word ""Shezan"" in any other manner whatsoever, expect as provided above.
2) The firm will not open any restaurant or hotel or motel or bakery or catering concern outside Pakistan neither under the style or title of 'Shezan' nor will it use the word 'Shezan' by prefixing or suffixing any word or expression with the same with regard to their business outside Pakistan.
3) The firm will not open any restaurant or hotel or motel or bakery or catering concern neither under the style or title of 'Shezan' nor will it use the word 'Shezan' by prefixing or suffixing any word or expression with the same, at any place in Pakistan except as provided in clause-one above.
4) The company shall not open or run any restaurant or hotel or motel or bakery or catering concern or snack bar under the name, style or title of 'Shezan' nor will it use the word 'Shezan' by prefixing or suffixing any word or expression with the same at any place within the territorial limits of the Lahore Division only in respect of business heretofore mentioned.'
The instant case was also not one in which the respondent was an honest concurrent user nor did it attract any of the other exceptions mentioned in subsection (2) of section 8 of the Act, which may have justified the acceptance of the Application of the respondent.
Therefore, for all the aforesaid reasons we have no hesitation in allowing this appeal by setting aside the judgment dated 14 May 2018 of the learned Judge of the High Court (passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003) and the decision dated 25 June 2003 of the learned Registrar of Trade Marks. Consequently, the Application No. 100857 dated 29 December 1988 of the respondent is dismissed. The respondent shall pay the costs of the appellant throughout.","The reason which prevailed with the Registrar, to dismiss the Opposition filed by the appellant and to allow the Application, was because of an agreement dated 19 February 1975 ('the Agreement') between the alleged predecessors of the parties. The parties to the Agreement were 'Shezan Limited, a private company ... through its Managing Director, Mr. Mahmood Nawaz' and 'Messrs Shezan Lahore, a partnership firm, through its managing partners, namely, (1) Ch. Riazuddin (2) Rao Mohammad Usman'. By placing reliance on the Agreement the Registrar (who referred to the respondent as the 'Applicant' and to the appellant as the 'Opponent') held, that:
'In view of the fact that Applicant is using the Trade Mark ""SHEZAN"" as a result of an agreement entered between both the parties in the year 1975 hence, there appeared to be no moral, ethical and legal justification for this opposition proceedings, particularly, when the Opponent has himself given the right to use mark and now he is opposing the registration of the said mark in favour of the Applicant when the Applicant is using the mark continuously since 1975 and no action has been taken by the Opponent. Hence, the applicant also qualifies for registration of the said mark under section 10(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940.'
The appellant preferred an appeal against the Registrar's order before the High Court. The learned Judge of the High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal, and did so by also relying upon the Agreement. Therefore, it would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant clauses of the Agreement, wherein Shezan Limited is referred to as 'the company' and Messrs Shezan Lahore as 'the firm':
'WHEREAS the company is, inter alia, carrying on the business of a hotel, restaurants and bakeries in the various towns of Pakistan including Lahore where they are running two restaurants, i.e., the Shezan Continental, 46-Dingah Singh Building, and Shezan Oriental, 7-Dayal Singh Mansions, Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore (hereinafter referred to as the two restaurants) together with a bakery to serve the two above said restaurants and sale of baking products;
AND WHEREAS the premises of Shezan Continental and Shezan Oriental have been rented by the company;
AND WHEREAS the company had effected, in the premises of the two restaurants, alterations and improvements to make them suitable for the purpose of modern restaurants and the material and fixtures used for the purpose of alterations and improvements could be removed by the company on the expiry of the lease;
AND WHEREAS in pursuance of negotiations the company has agreed to sell and the firm has agreed to buy the goodwill of the said Shezan Continental, the Shezan Oriental and the Shezan Bakery at a price paid against an acknowledgment receipt.",MWA/S-22/SC Appeal allowed.,Allowed

","Civil Petition No. 3795 of 2021, decided on 8th November, 2021.
(Against the judgment dated 26.02.2021 of the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad passed in F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020)
","8th November, 2021.","MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.","It was averred that the petitioner and respondent No.1 entered into a partnership agreement to conduct business of promoting, developing and managing international franchises. A partnership firm was thus formed and registered by the name of Zakori International (""Zakori International""). Zakori International is currently operating two successful brands in Pakistan namely ""Mr. COD"" and ""RANCHERS"". ""RANCHERS"", being an indigenous brand of Zakori International, the trademark ""Ranchers"" has been registered under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance 2001""), in the joint name of the partners, being the petitioner and respondent No.1. It is further stated that under and in terms of a franchise agreement dated 13.10.2015, Zakori International granted to Messrs Royal Manor a limited license and franchise for operating a ""Ranchers"" Restaurant in Sector 1-8 (Markaz), Islamabad. However the respondent No.1, without the consent of the petitioner, entered, on behalf of Zakori International, into a tripartite Joint Venture Agreement (""JVA"") with Messrs Royal Manor, and one Afnan Shareef, the Respondent No.2, whereby Royal Manor agreed to take respondent No.2, as its joint venture partner in respect of the franchise restaurants operated by it under the name and style of ""Ranchers"", whereas Zakori International in terms of the said JVA, purportedly undertook to grant master franchising rights regarding ""Ranchers"" to respondent No.2. The petitioner contended that Zakori International could not have participated in the aforesaid JVA without the consent of the petitioner. It was further contended that by having agreed to extend to respondent No.2, the right of master franchising ""Ranchers"" unilaterally, and without the consent of the petitioner, the respondent No.2 has clearly infringed the registered trade mark, jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, against the clear restriction imposed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001. In addition to the above, according to the petitioner, respondent Nos.1 and 2, have incorporated a Private Limited Company by the name of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3, mainly for the same business as is being conducted by Zakori International under its trade mark ""Ranchers"". It was contended that the use of the trade mark/name, ""Ranchers"", by respondent No.3 company, will create an impression and lead to a belief that the entity is not different from, ""Ranchers"" jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, and such would ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"".","The first grievance of the petitioner that emerges from the plain reading of the plaint, and as noted earlier, is that though the petitioner and respondent No.1 are the co-owners of the registered trade mark ""Ranchers"" and the partnership agreement between the two does not authorize any of them to grant a license to the use of the said trade mark, or assign or charge each other's share therein, and exactly to the same effect is the restriction placed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001, however the respondent No.1 without the petitioner's consent granted master franchise rights in respect of the subject trade mark to respondent No.2, which is clearly violative of the above provision and thus in terms of subsection (6) of section 24 of the said Ordinance, which clearly entitles the aggrieved co-proprietor to initiate infringement proceedings in such an eventuality, the petitioner was/is fully competent to institute the proceedings as he did.
7. The other grievance as set out in the plaint is that the respondent No.1 and respondent No.2, along with two others have incorporated a private limited company by the name and style of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3. It is contended that the name of the company conspicuously bearing the name ""Ranchers"" whose principal line of business is the same as that being conducted by the Zakori International under the trade mark/name ""Ranchers"" would lead a consumer into believing that the respondent No.3 company is associated with the ""Ranchers"" brand owned by Zakori International, and thus using the name ""Ranchers"" as above is a clear infringement of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" as described/explained by section 40 of the Ordinance 2001, in terms whereof a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses, in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or deceitfully similar thereto, in relation to similar goods or services for which the same is registered, whereas subsection (5) of section 40 holds unauthorized use of a registered trade mark as one's own trade name or part of his trade name, as an infringement of the trade mark, and this is what exactly is being complained of by the petitioner.
","In view of the forgoing we convert this petition into an appeal and allow the same, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the tribunal to proceed therewith in accordance with law.","Although, as noted above, the respondents' acts and conduct as alleged by the petitioner clearly falls under sections 24 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 respectively, but for the sake of clarity we may observe here that use of trade mark can also be attributed to the person who has got to the stage where he can be seen objectively to have committed himself to use the mark that is to carrying his intention to use the mark into effect. Use of trade mark can therefore be demonstrated also through the intention to offer the goods and services and/or services, which are manifested through preparatory steps which show an objective commitment to using the trade mark, whereas in the instant case the respondents, in addition to having violated specific provisions of Ordinance, 2001, have also gone beyond the preparatory steps. We wonder as to where from the question of so called physical use arose.
Keeping in view certain observations found in the judgments of the fora below, we feel that a clear exposition with regard to the concept of passing off would be beneficial, and it would be appropriate to reproduce the concept as enunciated in Harvard's Law Review, Volume 68 (1954-1955) on the subject of development in the law.
Whereas though in the instant case, the petitioner contended that use of ""Ranchers"", as part of the company's name ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"", however, as noted earlier, has in fact alleged violation of specific restriction imposed by two separate provisions of Ordinance 2001, which are clearly based on infringement of petitioner's trade mark, within the meaning of the said two provisions.
It may also be relevant to note that what is described as a passing off action may either be a passing off action simplicitor or an action of infringement of trade mark coupled with passing off. Where the case of passing off action is based on infringement of trade mark, such suit shall necessarily require determination of the question whether there had been any infringement of the trade mark and where infringement of trade mark is alleged the suit must, in view of sections 17, 18 and 39 of the IPO Act, 2012, be instituted before the tribunal notwithstanding that the allegations in the suit were coupled with the allegation of passing off.

","C. R. No. 68-P of 2021, decided on 1st April, 2022.","1st April, 2022.","MUSARRAT HILALI, J.","Precisely the stated facts of the case as recapitulated from the available record are that the petitioner applied for renewal of agreement with Shell Pakistan and while the process was in progress when in the meanwhile, the Ministry of Industries and Production Department Explosive vide office order dated 06.04.2020 sealed the filling station. The sealing order issued by respondent No.2 was challenged before the learned Civil Judge, Peshawar, however, the same was returned to the petitioner under Order VII, Rule 10, C.P.C. for lack of jurisdiction. The appeal filed thereagainst was also dismissed by the learned Appellate Court which has been impugned herewith.","Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that there is no issue between the petitioner and the Shell Pakistan Limited rather the license to the petitioner was issued by OGRA which is valid up till 23.09.2022. He next contended that in case respondent No.6 is not willing to continue business with the petitioner, then petitioner has every right to enter with any other company/firm.","Accordingly, this civil revision petition is disposed of in the above terms.","As against that, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.6 while rebutting the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner stated that no doubt the petitioner has got every right to carry business of filling station by entering into agreement with any company of its choice, however, it shall not use the monogram of Shell Pakistan Limited on any of its display point.
No doubt under Article 18 of the Constitution, every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful trade or business, however, it does not allow unauthorized use of another's trade mark to capture consumer attention as using another's trade mark is much like posting a sign with another's trade mark in front of one's store just to confuse or deceive the buyer.
Since the petitioner has entered into agreement with Messrs 21C HTL for his business activities, therefore, petitioner is directed to remove all symbols/marks indicating or showing any resemblance or confusion with the monogram of Shell Pakistan Limited. Both the parties i.e. the petitioner and respondents Nos.5 and 6 have readily agreed to the conclusion arrived at by this Court. The petitioner may, however, approach a proper forum having jurisdiction for any other matter arising out of this civil revision as during the course of arguments no other issue except the one discussed above, has been raised by learned counsel for the petitioner. Consequently, the order of sealing dated 06.04.2020 is set aside subject to removal of bill boards and other signs/symbols creating any confusion with regard to the trade mark of Shell Pakistan.",SA/219/P Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE ISSUED TO EIGHT (8) CAMPUSES OF DAR-E-ARQAM SCHOOLS:
","In the matter of
F. No. 281/DAR-E-ARQAM.CCP.OFT/17, decided on 8th August, 2019.
","13th March, 3rd and 22nd April, 2019.",Nil,"The Complainant in its complaint stated that its business ""Dar-e-Arqam School"" is presently known as one of the best quality education service provider in Pakistan, for which the Complainant converted his partnership business into private limited company named as ""Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited in year 2009. The Complainant initially entered into franchise agreements with the Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 which were later expired or terminated by the Complainant and no agreement was ever signed with Respondent No. 6. Furthermore, the Respondent No. 7 started their campuses with the name similar to the project name of the Complainant i.e. Tarbiyah which was brainchild of the Complainant and it was introduced in 2014 under Total Child Development Plan (TCDP). The use of Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and deceptive use of Complainant's project name ""Tarbiyah"" by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8 without any due authorization, constitutes, prima facie, violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, acts of the Respondents are not only misleading the consumers about their services but are also capable of harming business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.","It is evident that the use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 and the deceptive use of the Complainant's project name i.e; Tarbiyah, by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8, is without any due authorization, thereby in violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, it also appears that the act of the Respondents Nos.1 to 8 is not only misleading the consumers regarding their products but it is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
5.2 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large and therefore, it is in the interest of the general public and fair competition in the market that the undertakings should be stopped from marketing their products in an unfair and misleading manner and be encouraged to resort to marketing practices which are transparent and give consumers true and correct information.
5.3 Therefore, in light of the above mentioned findings, it is recommended that show cause notices may be issued to Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 for, prima facie, violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(a)(b) and (d) of the Act.""
Based on the material available on the record i.e. the Enquiry Report, SCN and the written replies filed by the Respondents following issue arise for determination:
(i) Whether the Complaint is instituted in accordance with the law?
(ii) Whether can Commission can proceed in the matter while there is pending civil/criminal litigation between the parties at various forums?
(iii) Whether the enquiry committee proceeded with mala fide intentions and conclusion of the Enquiry Report is biased?
(iv) Whether the Respondent has violated the provisions of section 10 of the Act?

","As noted in the preceding paragraphs, it is established that the Respondents have engaged in deceptive marketing practices prohibited under section 10(2)(a), (b) and (d) read with section 10(1) of the Act. Therefore, for reasons mentioned in preceding paragraph we deem it appropriate to impose a penalty in the amount of PKR 5,000,000 (Rupees Five Million Only) on the proprietor of the Respondent institutions, collectively. In addition to the foregoing, we cannot ignore the fact, which though is discussed in Paras 6 and 7 above, however, we deems it appropriate to refer to it again that the Respondents from the first date showed reluctance in making submissions before us and got an adjournment on one pretext or the other. On the first date of hearing, despite receipt of notice much in advance, an adjournment was requested to file written reply. On the second hearing, i.e. 03rd April 2019, the authorized representative again requested for adjournment. Subsequently hearing was scheduled for 22nd April 2019 and on the said date, despite service and receipt of the notice neither anyone appeared on behalf of the Respondents nor was any written request made on their behalf or by them. Therefore, we decided to proceed ex-parte against the Respondents on 22nd April 2019 in accordance with provision to subsection (2) of section 30 of the Act read with clause (e) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 26 of the in the matter pursuant to Regulation 26(2)(e) of Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007. The foregoing attitude of delaying tactics falls squarely within the purview of clause (e) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act i.e. knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the process of the Commission to conclude the proceedings. Accordingly, in pursuance of clause (c) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act, we are constrained to impose a further penalty of PKR 500,000/-(Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) on the proprietor of the Respondents for knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the proceedings before us. The proprietor of the Respondent Institutions are directed to deposit the imposed penalty with the Registrar of the Commission, within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this order.
The Proprietor of the Respondent Institutions is also directed to publish in atleast two national daily newspapers that they have no affiliation or association with the Complainant within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this Order and to refrain from indulging in any form of deceptive marketing practices in the future and is forewarned that repeat violations may attract further stricter penalties as per the law.","The Respondents have made the submission through their written reply that filing/institution of the Complaint is questionable due to the fact that Mr. Bajwa's Breach of his affidavit as an Advocate. Although the ground raised by the Respondents is not clear, however, given the challenge made to the validity of the complaint under the provisions of the Act, we deem it appropriate to address the issue at hand. The complaint for violation of any provisions of the Act can be filed under section 37(2) of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
Section 37(2) where the Commission received from an undertaking or a registered association of consumers in writing of such facts as appear to constitute a contravention of the provision of Chapter II, it shall, unless it is of opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or is not substantiated by prima facie evidence conduct an enquiry into the matter to which the complaint relates.
23. The Legal Advisor in attendance referred to the earlier Orders In the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Kamyu.Pk reported as 2018 CLD 919, wherein while interpreting the provisions of section 37(2) and validity of the complaint observed as follows:
10. In the instant matter the proceedings were initiated on a complaint filed by Mr. Umair Ali through email dated 30th April 2015. Further perusal of the contents of the Complaint reveals that the Complainant had approached the Commission as a consumer and not as an undertaking. The competent authority also initiated the enquiry on the aforesaid complaint under section 37(2) of the Act. It needs to be appreciated that the Commission is not empowered under section 37(2) of the Act to proceed with an enquiry on the complaint of the consumer, rather, the legislature in all its wisdom has categorically outlined that the complaint is to be filed either by the 'undertaking' or 'registered association of consumers'. Before proceeding further it is relevant to refer to the definition of 'undertaking' as provided under clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
(q) ""undertaking"" means any natural or legal person, governmental body including a regulatory authority, body corporate, partnership, association, trust or other entity in any way engaged, directly or indirectly, in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services and shall include an association or undertakings;
11. The Commission in one of its recent Orders i.e. Order dated 15th December 2017 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Utility Stores Corporation of Pakistan (Private) Limited has defined the term 'undertaking', in the following manner:
""29. A bare perusal of the definition of an undertaking' leaves no doubt that it is divided in two parts. The first part of the definition takes within its folds the types of entities that can possibly exist i.e. an individual, a company, a firm, an association of undertakings, governmental entities, sector-regulators, a body corporate established under the Provincials or the Federal laws of Pakistan, a cooperative society and any other entity regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. Whereas the second part focuses on the nature of activity which is performed by them be it directly or indirectly i.e. production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services. The most important part of the second limb of the definition is that the legislature within its wisdom by using the words 'in any way' (emphasis added), has made it clear that there is no condition on the legal entity to engage in commercial or economic activity to fall within the purview of 'undertaking' for the purposes of the Act. If any legal entity or natural person is engaged in any way in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services, the said undertaking would fall within the purview of the term `undertaking'.""
12. We are cognizant of the fact that nowhere in the definition of `undertaking' the word 'consumer' is used. Upon analysis it is noticed that the term 'consumer' though is not defined under the Act, has been used in various other provisions, the instances are as follows:
a) In clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'dominant position',
b) In clause (k) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'relevant market',
c) In clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Act outlining the criteria for grant of exemptions,
d) In clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act, in the instance of deceptive marketing practices.
13. There is no doubt that apart from providing for free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity and to enhance economic efficiency, the scope of the Act is also to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices, which inter alia include the deceptive marketing practices. Although the term 'consumer' is not defined in the Act, however, in other consumer protection laws the term has been defined. It has been held by the august Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Muhammad Hussain Patel v. Habib Wali Muhammad, PLD 1981 SC 1, that definition from other statute can only be borrowed from other statutes where both the statutes are pari materia. The question is when statutes are considered pari materia, in this regard we draw guidance from the judgment of Honorable Sindh High Court reported as Murtaza Flour Mills (Private) Limited v. Federation of Pakistan and others, 1996 MLD 1273, wherein the Honourable Court has held:
...[s]tatutes in pari materia are statutes which are so related as to form a system or code of legislation and when they relate to same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things or have the same purpose or object it is only then that the statutes are called in pari material...
14. Keeping in view the above approach in mind, the consumer protections laws are framed to protect the interests of the consumers. Similarly, the Act also provides for protection of consumers, hence, we are of the considered view that the definition of 'consumer' can be borrowed from the consumer protection legislation inforce. The definitions are as follows:
(i) Subsection (3) of section 2 of the Islamabad Consumer Protection Act, 1995 has defined the 'consumer' in the following terms:
(3) ""consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment or hire purchase and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(ii) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(c) ""consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtains on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any services for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services;
(iii) Clause (e) of section 2 of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2014 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtain on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any service for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services,
(iv) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997 has defined the consumers in the following terms:
(c) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or to promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(v) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Balochistan Consumers Protection Act, 2003 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised' to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire. Purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
. It is clear from the facts available on the record that the Complainant was a consumer and the complaint was not filed on behalf of any registered association of the consumers. Since, a consumer does not fall within the purview of the definition of 'undertaking', hence, we hereby conclude that the initiation of the enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act on the basis of the complaint in question was in fact violative of the express provisions of law. We note that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint filed with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. In this regard reference is made to National Feeds Limited v. Competition Commission of Pakistan, 2016 CLD 1688.
24. In the aforesaid Order Re: Kamyu.Pk the Commission has clarified that who can file a complaint with the Commission under section 37(2) of the Act. In the instant matter, the complaint was filed under section 37(2) of the Act by Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation through one of its Director namely Mr. Akhter Bajwa and a Board Resolution as well as the Authority letter in favour of Mr. Akhter Bajwa was filed along with the Complaint. The Respondents have raised no objection on the authorization, rather an allegation has been levelled that Mr. Bajwa being an Advocate cannot do any other business. The Legal Advisor to the Commission has also highlighted that the current proceedings before this Bench pertains to violation of section 10 of the Act and the Commission and this Bench is not an appropriate authority to take any action against Mr. Bajwa in terms of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.
25. After carefully reviewing the merits and the submissions made before us vis- -vis the first issues, we agree with the submissions made by the Legal Advisor in attendance and re-emphasise that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint fled with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. The instant complaint was filed by the Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation are unquestionably an 'undertaking' in terms of clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, through its' duly authorized representative and no objection on the authority so bestowed upon Mr. Bajwa has been called into question. Instead, allegations against Mr. Bajwa has been made for violating the affidavit and the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973. 
We now proceed to address the issue No. (ii), in the matter based on the record available. There are several ongoing civil suits which primarily tempted the Respondents to raise this objection in the instant proceedings.
i. Respondent's suit in Rawalpindi,
ii. Respondent's suit in Peshawar,
iii. Respondent's suit in Islamabad,
iv. Respondent has field a revision petition before the High Court,
v. Complainant has filed a suit in the court of Intellectual Property Tribunal.
27. Mr. Farooqi while addressing this aspect has placed reliance and referred to an earlier Order passed by the Commission In the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for deceptive marketing practices, reported as 2016 CLD 105, wherein it was observed as follows:
""15. We find this argument to be without merit. Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of `res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision. As explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 of C.P.C. is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits ' pending in courts.
16. Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The relevant portion is reproduced below for convenience:
Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act XLV of 1860), and the Commission shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
17. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi-judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'Court ' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court. Furthermore, the settled interpretation of section 10 of the C.P.C. provides that for the section to be applicable, the two suits must be pending before courts of competent jurisdiction. In Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Messrs Azeem Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. for example, it was held by the Sindh High Court that where proceedings are not in the nature of a civil suit and are instead special proceedings provided for under special law, the provisions of section 10 of the C.P.C. would not be attracted.
Apart from the above, no other mala fide has been alleged by the Respondents. It is a settled principle of law that mala fide is to be proved through independent and cogent evidence, mere allegation are not sufficient. For the foregoing we place reliance on the case of Zulfiqar Ali v. Province of Punjab, reported as 2018 PLC (C.S) 842. In addition to the foregoing, we also refer to the case of Shafi Mohammad v. State, reported as 2017 YLR 317, wherein it was held that the burden of proof is on the one who alleges mala fide on part of Complainant or the investigation agency.
The issue in this case is the deceptive use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and of its project name i.e; Tarbiyah by Respondents without prior authorization. In this context, whether the information that ultimately reached the consumer is false or misleading and has the capacity to harm the business interests of the complainant under sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b), respectively and whether the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's trademark under section 10(2)(d).
","In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.

SAMSONITE IP HOLDINGS S.a.r.l. and others---Respondents
","F.A. O. No. 17802 of 2019, decided on 28th March, 2019.","28th March, 2019","Amin-ud-Din Khan, J.","Through this appeal filed under Order XLII, Rule 1(r) of the C.P.C. the appellant; who is plaintiff, has challenged the order dated 16.01.2019 passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore, whereby an application for grant of temporary injunction, under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. was dismissed.
2. Yesterday, when the case was fixed for preliminary hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant was not available. The learned counsel for the respondents appeared with the permission of the Court at preliminary hearing stage, filed power of attorney and raised two objections that the appeal is barred by time and that the notice sent to the respondents in compliance with the Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. does not contain the copy of grounds of appeal, therefore, notice was defective one.
3. Mr. Ali Mohsin Qazalbash Advocate appeared along with Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat Advocate and stated that he is signatory of the notice sent to the respondents under Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. and the said notice mentioning the memo of appeal is attached and he confirms that memo of appeal was attached with the notice.
4. So far as the objection of learned counsel for the respondents with regard to the limitation is concerned; she stated that as order is dated 16.01.2019 and the respondents applied for issuance of certified copy, which were provided within a week, therefore, she has the impression that the appeal is barred by time when it was filed in this court on 26.03.2019.
5. The record was checked in the presence of learned counsel for the parties. As per certified copy of the impugned order attached with this appeal, the appellant moved an application for issuance of certified copy of the impugned order on 17.01.2019, which was prepared and delivered on 27.02.2019 and the appeal was filed on 26.03.2019. Therefore, it is within the prescribed period of limitation. Learned counsel for the respondents states that in this eventuality she will not press the point of limitation and further when the statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the grounds of appeal were attached with the notice, she will also not press the other objection.
","It will be appropriate that the prayer of suit as well as prayer of the application moved under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. be reproduced. The prayer of the suit is as fellows:-
""It is respectfully prayed that this honourable Court may be pleased to pass a decree against the Defendants and and/or their chief executives, directors, secretaries, principal officer's, managers, shareholders, employees, servants, distributors, men, agents, stockists, retailers or dealers (hereinafter jointly referred to as the Defendants) in the following terms:-
a) pass a decree for declaration that the Plaintiff is the Proprietor and prior user in its own right of the trademark SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, used for retail stores on account of prior adoption and actual prior use of SAMSONITE for retail stores in class 35 for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., in Pakistan since year 2005 and AMERICAN TOURISTER thereafter for past 10 years, and that the Plaintiff is entitled under law to conduct its business of running retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., using SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER;
b) pass a decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants perpetually from using and advertising in any manner and in any media, SAMSONITE, alone or as house of Samsonite and AMERICAN TOURISTER for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., stores within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls, either themselves in Pakistan or through a franchise or distributor or licensee, agent in relation to luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc, of all types and related products or any limitation of Plaintiff's proprietary trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan, such as house of Samsonite and from committing acts of Unfair Competition in terms of section 67 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 and from passing off Defendants retail stores, services and business by using SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER as and for that of the Plaintiff.

h) costs of the suit may also be awarded; and
i) grant any other relief that this honourable Court may deem appropriate.""
The prayer made in the application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. is as follows:
""It is therefore, respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the titled suit, this honourable Court may be pleased to issue a temporary injunction restraining the Defendants from using in any manner trademark SAMSONITE alone or as House of Samsonite, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., or for store within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls and restrained from advertising trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan in any manner in any media for retail stores.
The Plaintiff also prays for an ad-interim injunction till the disposal of this application.""
","I have noticed that there is an order passed by the court of competent jurisdiction i.e. High Court of Sindh at Karachi, the operative part of the order dated 24.07.2018 is as under:-
""I have come to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have already made out a prima facie case of infringement under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, as the defendant even after submitting an undertaking before the Court is still using the identical signage in the name of ""Samsonite"" for which there is not consent of the owner/proprietor of the trademark/trade name, in relation to goods and services falling within Class 18 and 35 of the Fourth Schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004, read with Rules, 11, 71 and 88 thereof, the injunction application bearing C.M.A. No. 12935/2017 is granted and the defendant and its officers, servants and agents are restrained from infringing the Samsonite Mark and or other marks of the plaintiffs and while allowing injunction application, I direct the Defendant to immediately remove the signage being used by them in their outlets within 30 days from the date of this order and shall file a proper affidavit to that effect in the office duly executed by any of the Directors and or owners of the Defendant company.
The appellant can contest and press all its right's before the said Court and while deciding the instant application learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore has passed the order in accordance with law. When the plaintiff/appellant failed to make out a case for grant of temporary injunction while showing the necessary ingredients i.e. prima facie arguable case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss in its favour, this Court has no reason to disagree with the findings recorded by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property, Lahore in the light of case law referred to by the learned counsel for the respondents. Consequently, this appeal having no substance stands dismissed in limine.","In the Court it was admitted that the brand of Samsonite is of the respondents and appellant is the sole distributor and the appellant set up independent Samsonite Stores, therefore, the suit was filed that the exclusive store is the idea of the plaintiff/appellant. States that for a long time they after set up the independent Samsonite Stores have a right that the injunctive order be granted on the basis of acquiescence on the part of respondents. Argues that the learned trial court fell in error while refusing the grant of temporary injunction on the ground that the damages have been claimed by the appellant, therefore, no case of grant of temporary injunction.
10. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents argues that no agreement in writing or distributorship has been provided. That the appellant was seller of the products of the respondents. That under Clause 18 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the respondents are registered and under Clause 35 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the proceedings are pending, which are being resisted by the appellant. That under sections 86(c) and 76 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 protection of use is with the respondents and the respondents Nos.1 and 2 appointed the respondent No.3 as distributor in the year 2016, therefore, the suit was filed by the appellant in the Sindh High Court and a suit bearing No.2040 of 2017 was flied by the respondents before the High Court of Sindh at Karachi and the application for grant of temporary injunction was allowed vide order dated 24.07.2018. States that the suit for declaration was filed in the civil court by the present appellant at Lahore, the suit was dismissed and the appeal there against was also dismissed. A suit for damages was also filed by the appellant, which was dismissed for non-prosecution. Now it has been restored.",SA/F-18/L Appeal dismisse,Dismissed

","Suit Nos. 596, 880 and J.M. No. 28 of 2019, decided on 22nd September, 2020.","4th, 25th November, 2019, 21st May and 19th August, 2020","ZAFAR AHMED RAJPUT, J.","Suit No. 596 of 2019 has been filed by the MMC against the MRC and others for declaration, permanent injunction against the alleged infringement of the registered trademark/trade name ""MASTER"", passing off and unfair competition under Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""Ordinance, 2001""), rendition of accounts and damages, alleging therein that it being part of Master Group of Industries has diversified into many different industries such as foam, furniture, rubber products, building material, solar, wind and green energy, textiles and general trading. Besides, through the sale of its commercial vehicles, it has also established itself as a major player in the automotive industries and the most popular categories of its vehicles are MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE. It is further alleged that in the year 2015, the MMC collaborated with Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co. Ltd. and established a manufacturing plant in Karachi and the vehicles manufactured and assembled by the MMC with the collaboration of said company are being sold under various brands such as MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. It is also alleged that the MMC's vehicles sold under the trademark/trade name MASTER, either alone or in conjunction with another mark, have become well reputed amongst transporters and are in high demand in Pakistan and other countries including USA, UAE, Bangladesh, India and Afghanistan and MMC has duly secured its rights in the brand MASTER and obtained registration of the same in the relevant class-12 with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. It is the claim of MMC that being the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER, it owns the exclusive rights of selling, trading and dealing with the said trademark/trade name. It is further claim of the MMC that the trademark MASTER is associated exclusively with it, rendering the unauthorized use of it in conjunction with any other mark in respect of the same or similar products by other manufactures, service providers and traders as infringement of the MMC's vested rights and any such unauthorized use would also tantamount to passing off as well as unfair competition. It is case of the MMC that the MRC is engaged in the import, distribution and sale of infringing products bearing trademark/trade name MASTER, that products include buses under the mark 'ROAD MASTER' which is deceptively similar to the MMC's registered trademark MASTER in sheer negation and contravention of statutory provision enunciated under sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 and such inexcusable act is an infringement of MMC's exclusive proprietary rights vested in the trademark MASTER for which it is entitled to a relief under section 46 of the Ordinance, 2001. It is further case of MMC that MRC has imported the said infringing goods into Pakistan via Sri Lanka; hence, MMC apprehends that more consignments may be en-routed. It is also case of MMC that it has filed a complaint with Director General IPR (Enforcement), Islamabad under the relevant laws to take enforcement action and detain the infringing goods/vehicles, which is still pending adjudication; however, MMC in order to ensure that the infringing vehicles are not released, have approached this Court through this suit. MMC has filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019, under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C., seeking interim injunctive relief restraining MRC, its agents etc. from using/ infringing the trademark MASTER from marketing, promoting, trading, importing and selling through retail outlets or online and from infringing products under the mark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER in any manner whatsoever and/or any close variation thereof till disposal of this suit. While C.M.A. No.7781/2019 has been filed by the MRC, under Order XXXIX, rule 4 read with section 151, C.P.C., seeking vacation, discharge and modification in interim relief granted by this Court, vide orders dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019 and C.M.A. No.10445/2019 has been filed by MMC, under Order XXXIX, rule 2(3), C.P.C., read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Act, seeking attachment of the properties and an order detaining the proposed contemnors in civil prison for breach of ad-interim orders, dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019, passed by this Court.","Mr. Mirza Mehmood Baig, learned counsel for MMC/plaintiff, while arguing listed applications in Suit No. 596/2019 has reiterated the facts of the plaint in said suit. He has contended that MMC is the registered proprietor of the trademark MASTER not only in Class 12 which pertains to the manufacture of the buses and apparatus for locomotion but also in Class 39 which pertains to transportation services and since MRC (defendant No.1 in said suit) is engaged in the import, distribution and/or sale of the infringing products bearing the trademark MASTER including buses under the mark ROAD MASTER, which is imitated mark upon the same goods of MMC, it filed Suit No.596/2019 inter alia to restrain MRC from using, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling of the plaintiff's products under the trademark MASTER and/or any variation thereof. He has further contended that vide ad-interim order, dated 01.04.2019, this Court restrained MRC from using the trademark and selling or infringing MMC's trademark MASTER; thereafter, vide order dated 15.4.2019, this Court extended the scope of the said ad-interim order to defendants Nos.2 to 7 and restrained them from releasing the goods carrying trademark of MMC and it was, thereafter, the MRC filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019 in said suit seeking discharge and/or modification of said interim order. He has further contended that the MRC has filed its counter affidavit to C.M.A. No. 5145/2019 wherein it has provided history of all its activities outside the transportation category with chronological developments and trademark registrations and applications that are entirely irrelevant to Classes 12 and 39. He has added that MRC instead of rebutting MMC's indomitable assertion and plea that it is the prior user and registered proprietor of the mark MASTER, placed its entire focus on irrelevant assertions, and miserably failed to establish prior use of the mark MASTER or ROAD MASTER upon buses or transportation services and MMC has already responded through its rejoinder to the counter affidavit submitted by MRC in response to the MMC's said C.M.A., wherein among other strong rebuttals, it has also been pointed out that MMC had secured interim relief in its favour as to the exclusive use of the trademark MASTER in numerous cases and foremost and relevant example of such relief in favour of MMC came about in Suit No.98/2019, filed before IPT Lahore, the very basis of that was its registration of the mark MASTER in Class 39.
On the other hand, Ms. Amna Salman Ahmed, learned counsel for MRC/defendant No.1 in Suit No.596/2019 while reiterating the facts of the plaint in Suit No.880/2019 has maintained that MMC has falsely claimed the ownership of the trademark MASTER, as the same has never been used by it, so also ROAD MASTER, for the goods and services falling in class 39, which MRC has been carrying out for its passenger and cargo transportation business. She has further maintained that the MMC has misused and abused its totally different class 12, Registration No.187815, which was malafidely and fraudulently obtained by it despite the fact that several MASTER formative marks were prior registered in class 12, therefore, MRC has filed J.M No. 28 of 2019 for the cancellation of the alleged registration of the trademark MASTER in class 12. She has also maintained that MRC is the bona fide user of mark ROAD MASTER in class 39 being the prior user of the said mark, furthermore, MMC has no justification to claim any right in relation to MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER used as a service mark in class 39 for passengers and cargo transportation services as they have never used MASTER or ROAD MASTER as a service mark for passengers and cargo transport services in class 39. She has further maintained that MRC's Master Group of Companies has honestly been using the trademark MASTER for four decades and it is well known throughout Pakistan and around the world, particularly in Middle East, therefore, MMC has no grounds to challenge the MRC's use of the trademark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER, by filing a suit and obtaining restraining orders against the MRC. She has added that MMC has violated section 19 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. She has further added that MMC has no legal or moral right to press its illegal demands against MRC. She has also maintained that the averments made by MMC in the suit are unauthorized, mala fide and an act of fraud upon MRC and the public and in fact MMC is attempting to get benefit from the impression that they are the exclusive users and owners of the trademark MASTER and ROAD MASTER, otherwise the fact that they neither have any prior use nor do they have any current use in class 39 clearly proves their malicious intentions. She has added that MMC has failed to make out a prima facie case against the MRC nor have they been able to prove that they have suffered any irreparable loss whatsoever and the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of MMC; and it is the MRC who is suffering irreparable loss due to mala fide and illegal actions of MMC restraining MRC's buses at the port which are to be used for transport services and; therefore, the application for interim injunction (C.M.A. No. 5145/2019) is liable to be dismissed. ","The interim relief has already been confirmed in favour of MMC in Suit No. 596 of 2019 by denying the same to MRC in Suit No. 880 of 2019. Hence, C.M.A. No.7496/2019 is dismissed being devoid of merit. While C.M.A. No.10447/2019, filed by the MMC under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. seeking rejection of J.M is dismissed as the learned counsel has failed to refer the provision of law under that the instant J.M. is not maintainable. Moreover, the MRC under the law has right to challenge the registration of subject trademark on legal and factual grounds; the merit thereof cannot by decided without recording pro and contra evidence of the parties.
Above are the reasons of my short order, dated 19.08.2020, whereby C.M.A. No. 5145 of 2019 in Suit No. 596 of 2019 was allowed and rest of the C.M.As. were dismissed.
","In terms of section 39 (ibid), a registered trade mark is a property and proprietor thereof thus has an exclusive right in a registered trademark and in case of any infringement, the proprietor has the right to obtain any relief under the Ordinance, 2001 and under any other law for the time being in force. Section 40 covers the instances and provides elements of the infringements. Under section 40(1), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in a course of trade, a mark which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services, which are identical with those, for which it is registered. Under section 40(2), a person infringes a registered trade mark if such person uses in the course of trade a mark which is deceptively similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to the goods or services for which the trade mark is registered. Under section 40(3), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to (a) goods of the same description as that of goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered; (b) services that are closely related to goods in respect of which trade mark is registered; (c) services of the same description as that of services in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or (d) goods that are closely related to services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Section 40 (4) provides that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trademark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered when deceptively similar to the registered trade mark. Section 40(5) stipulates that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses such registered trade mark as his trade name or part of his trade name.
It appears from the pleadings of the parties that MMC claims to be a part of Master Group of Industries and is indulged in sale of commercial vehicles in the name of MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE and also manufacturing and selling buses under brand name MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. Profiles of said vehicles are annexed with plaint as annexure ""D"" at page 193 to 223. MMC claims that it has protected its rights in the brand MASTER by obtaining registration of the same in the relevant Class 12 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, pertaining to vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water, with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. Trademark Registration Certificate is annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""F"" at page 227.
it has been asserted that MMC is not the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER for passenger and cargo transport business and services in Class 39 and it is the MRC who has prior use of ROAD MASTER as a service mark in said class. In its Affidavit-in-Rejoinder, MMC while rebutting the said assertion of the MRC has stated that it has been using the trademark MASTER upon services falling in class 39 since long before its use by MRC. Learned counsel for the MMC with his written synopsis has filed copy of the Trademark Registration Certificate bearing No. 197433 with filing date as 19-06-2004, which shows that MMC's trademark MASTER is registered in class 39, which was renewed for 10 years with effect from 19.06.2014 to 19.06.2024. It has been observed in the case of Messrs Dewan (supra) by this Court that once a trademark is registered under the provisions of Ordinance, 2001 it restricts the other parties from using such trade mark.",MH/M-50/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

Nos. 5628 and 9830 of 2020. Former C.M.A. has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff, under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2 read with section 151, C.P.C., seeking interim injunctive relief restraining the defendant from using the (i) brand name, copy right and trademark 'Baroque' on any of its products or for marketing its products and carrying on business under the name of 'Baroque'; (ii) from opening any shop and retail showroom under the name of 'Baroque' for showcasing, retailing and selling their clothes, garments or any other products; and (iii) using the web domain www.baroque.pk or any other similar domain involving the word 'Baroque', while latter C.M.A. has been filed on behalf of defendant No. 2 under Order XXXIX, rule 4 read with sections 94 and 151, C.P.C. seeking setting aside ad-interim order dated 15.07.2020, whereby the defendants were restrained from using brand name of the plaintiff.","Whether the defendants' use of the trademark 'Baroque' constitutes trademark infringement or passing off.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interim injunctive relief sought.","I have noticed that the similarity between the two marks is so striking and the intention to infringe is so obvious that the argument of balance of convenience is of no avail to the defendant. I am also of the view that since prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff; it does not open to the defendants to say that they ought to be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong. Moreover, the pendency of the application of defendant No.2 for registration of his mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks will not disentitle the plaintiff being proprietor of a registered trade mark from his exclusive right to its use and that such right will be deemed to be infringed by any person who uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling to as it likely to deceive or cause confusion in view of sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance. I have gone through the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the defendants and I am of the view that the same on being distinguishable facts and law do not advance the case of the defendants. I, therefore, allow C.M.A. No. 5628 of 2020, as prayed. Consequently, C.M.A. No. 9830 of 2020 stands dismissed on being infructuous.","It appears from the pleadings of the parties that the plaintiff claims to have launched Baroque's first showroom in Karachi in the year 2007 and secured the said brand and the interests associated with it by registering it with the name of ""'Baroque"" with the Trademark Registry at Karachi in the relevant Classes 20, 24 to 27, 35, 37 and 42 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, in February, 2016 and also got it registered as a copyright since January, 2017 under the category of ""Artistic Work"" (label design) with the Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan, Copyright office, Karachi bearing registration No. 35172-Copr. It is also claim of the plaintiff that even prior to the registration of the ""Baroque Inc."" trademark and copyright, the plaintiff's rights in the use of mark ""Baroque"" were protected under the law of passing off in view of the use of the mark by her since the year 2001. Trademark Registration Certificates are annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""E/1"" to ""E/1"" at page 133 to 147 and Certificate of Registration of Copyright in the artistic work (label design) Baroque is annexed as annexure ""F"" at page 149.

it may be observed that the plaintiff's trademark is admittedly registered under Classes 25 and 26 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, which are related to wearing apparel, clothing etc. and fabric and furniture trimmings and the defendant No.2 is admittedly offering his goods/ wearing apparel and clothing, which being falling under the Class 25 are identical with the name of BAROQUE and the consumer served are of the same category, as such, the features of defendants' goods do make out a case of there being likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their source",KMZ/M-13/Sindh Application allowed.,Allowed

","Suits Nos. 94 and 124 of 2020, decided on 7th April, 2020.","6th February, 2020.","ADNAN IQBAL CHAUDHRY, J.","The dispute between the parties is over the use of the name of the celebrity, late Junaid Jamshed. This order decides competing applications for temporary injunction moved in the subject suits.
2. Jazaa Foods (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter 'Jazaa Foods') is in the business of packing and distributing food items such as rice, fried onion, spices etc. It's trade mark 'Jazaa' is registered in Class 30 in respect of rice, wheat flour, flour milling products, sauces (condiments), spices etc. The late Junaid Jamshed was one of the founding members/ shareholder of Jazaa Foods and presently one of his sons is a shareholder and Director thereof. Therefore, in conjunction with it's registered trade mark 'Jazaa', the goods of Jazaa Foods bear the words 'by Junaid Jamshed', hereinafter referred to as 'the mark1 in question', albeit those words are not part of the registered trade mark of Jazaa Foods.
3. U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. is in the business of manufacturing clothing, ready-wear garments, footwear, bags, fragrances etc. bearing the trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed', which goods are then supplied by it to the company, Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd., for onward retail. Per Suit No. 94/2020, the late Junaid Jamshed was a shareholder also in Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd., and presently, his son is still shareholder. However, the registered trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed' is the property of U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd., and the company Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. is an authorized user thereof pursuant to a licence. The Defendant No.3 of Suit No. 94/2020 is the Chief Executive of both U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. and Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. (collectively 'U&I Garments'). The trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed' is registered not only in Classes in respect of textiles, garments, footwear and handbags, it is also registered in a number of other Classes including Class 30 (rice, spices etc.) in which the trade mark of Jazaa Foods is registered.
4. Suit No. 94/2020 has been filed by Jazaa Foods (plaintiff No.1) and by Taimur Jamshed son of late Junaid Jamshed (plaintiff No.2) inter alia for an injunction to restrain U&I Garments and others from creating hindrances or obstructions in the use by Jazaa Foods of the mark in question, and by C.M.A. No. 745/2020 they pray for a temporary injunction accordingly. It is the case of the said plaintiffs that the business of Jazaa Foods had been started by the late Junaid Jamshed along with other members; that during his lifetime Junaid Jamshed spear-headed the marketing campaign of Jazaa Foods, and in that vein, given his celebrity status, he had vide a written authorization dated 28-06-2016, permitted Jazaa Foods to use the mark in question; that Jazaa Foods has ever since been using the mark in question without any objection from U&I Garments; that in December 2019, three years after the death of the Junaid Jamshed, the Defendant No.3 who is the Chief Executive of U&I Garments, asked Jazaa Foods to obtain a licence from U&I Garments for the use of the mark in question, thus implying that unless Jazaa Foods obtains such a licence, U&I Garments would treat that as an infringement of its trade mark; and that on the refusal of Jazaa Foods to comply, the Defendant No.3 has threatened to impede and damage the business of Jazaa Foods.
5. Right after Suit No. 94/2020, U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. and Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter collectively 'U&I Garments) also filed Suit No. 124/2020 against Jazaa Foods inter alia for trade mark infringement and for passing-off. By C.M.A. No. 933/2020, U&I Garments has prayed for a temporary injunction to restrain Jazaa Foods from using the mark in question in any fashion or manner.
","The effect of the disclaimer in the trade mark registration of U&I Garments is that unless the name 'Junaid Jamshed' is used by another in substantially the same fashion and get-up as used by U&I Garments (Table I supra), it cannot claim to be aggrieved. A comparison of the mark in question with the trade mark of U&I Garments shows that there is no similarity in the fashion and get-up of the name 'Junaid Jamshed' as used in the two marks. Therefore, in view of section 42(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, the said use by Jazaa Foods of the name 'Junaid Jamshed' would not constitute trade mark infringement. As regards the allegation of passing-off, it is settled law that an action for passing-off is essentially to protect 'property in goods' based on the reputation of those goods, as distinct from an action to protect a trade mark which is a property in itself (see Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090). ","Given the disclaimer and its effect discussed above inter alia, U&I Garments does not have a prima facie case for the grant of a temporary injunction to restrain the use of the mark in question by Jazaa Foods; the balance of convenience is not in its favour, nor would it suffer any irreparable loss if injunction is refused as apparently no action has been taken by it against the use of the mark in question by Jazaa Foods since 2016. Conversely, Jazaa Foods meets the test of the said three ingredients for the grant of a temporary injunction. Jazaa Foods has relied upon photographs to show that during his lifetime, Junaid Jamshed himself used his name (mark in question) to promote Jazaa Foods; that the mark in question is being used by Jazaa Foods at least since 2016 without objection; that Junaid Jamshed had given a written authorization to Jazaa Foods to use his name; and therefore unless the Defendants of Suit No. 94/2020 (U&I Garments and others) are restrained from interfering in the said use, Jazaa Foods is likely to suffer irreparable loss. Consequently, C.M.A. No. 933/2020 moved by the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 124/2020 is dismissed; whereas, C.M.A. No. 745/2020 moved by the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 94/2020 is granted in terms that pending suit the Defendants of Suit No. 94/2020 are restrained from interfering in the use of the mark/name 'by Jamshed Junaid' by Jazaa Foods in conjunction with their registered trademark 'Jazaa' in Class 30 in the fashion and get-up that appears in Table II supra.","In Muhammad Ashraf v. Muhammad Akram (2016 MLD 389) it was held that the principle that registration of a trade mark gives rise to a prima facie case, balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable loss, that principle would be applicable where the trade mark was registered without a disclaimer, restriction or limitation; and that where a disclaimer, restriction or limitation to the exclusive use of any word/feature/description of a trade mark is imposed pursuant to section 21 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, then such disclaimer, restriction or limitation would have to be considered while determining an application for temporary injunction.",MWA/J-10/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

JUDGMENT
","GHULAM AZAM QAMBRANI, J.","Brief facts necessary for adjudication of this appeal are that the appellant filed a suit for perpetual injunction against infringement of registered trade mark against the defendants contending therein that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 entered into a partnership agreement at Islamabad on 28.11.2013, forming a Firm in the name and style of ""Messrs Zakori International"" with its office at Murree Road, Rawalpindi; that the said Firm was duly registered with Registrar of Firms Rawalpindi under the partnership Act; that after establishing Messrs Zakori International, the appellant/plaintiff became busy in his other business ventures abroad. The appellant/plaintiff had to act as a dormant partner of Messrs Zakori International, hence he reposed his complete trust in respondent/defendant No.1 on the basis of family relationship and past association; that respondent No.1 was running all the day to day affairs of the Firm since beginning and all the record of business and accounts was in his control. However, as per business needs, the appellant/plaintiff used to inject capital in the business as required by respondent No.1; that bank account of Messrs Zakori International was also operated by respondent No.1, who was also having control over the business of Messrs Zakori International and the appellant/plaintiff had complete trust and confidence in him; that Messrs Zakori international is currently operating two successful brands i.e. Mr. COD with 22 branches across Pakistan, two in Afghanistan and one in Bahrain and Ranchers, an indigenous brand of Zakori International having two branches one in the Rawalpindi and the other in Islamabad; that trade mark Ranchers has been registered jointly in the name of respondent/defendant No.1 and the appellant/plaintiff under section 33(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 by the Registrar of Trade Mark vide No.401490 dated 06.11.2015, which means that all the Intellectual property rights relating to the Ranchers are vested in Zakori International, which in equal shares, is jointly owned by the appellant/plaintiff and respondent No.1; that despite the fact that the appellant and respondent No.1 were joint owners of the registered trade mark namely ""Ranchers"", respondent No.1 initiated the process of granting master franchising rights of Ranchers to respondent No.2 without obtaining prior consent from the appellant by executing a Joint ventures partnership agreement for Ranchers the J.V agreement was made on 01.04.2017, at Islamabad. The grievance of the appellant is that respondent No.1 without consent of the plaintiff and in violation of the partnership deed dated 28.11.2013, is executing joint venture partnership agreement of ""Ranchers"" with defendant No.2, through defendant No.3 in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; that signing of the joint agreement by defendant No.1 with defendant No.2 without consent and approval of plaintiff constitutes infringement of registered trade mark of plaintiff within the meaning of section 40(5) read with section 46 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001.",The main proposition falling for determination is as to whether the learned Tribunal has the jurisdiction or not.,"For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order does not call for any interference at this end, hence the appeal is devoid of any substance, therefore, the same is dismissed.","Here the question arises that whether mere usage of registered trademark belonging to a person by another person constitutes infringement and whether that usage need to be necessarily in the course of trade and whether usage of trade mark while executing any agreement constitutes infringement. The contention of the appellant side is that agreement between defendants Nos.1 and 2 has been executed in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, therefore, the same constitutes an infringement within the meaning of section 40(5) of the Ordinance, ibid, and accordingly the same is actionable under section 46(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, meaning thereby that according to section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, the defendant ought to physically use the trade mark of the plaintiff in the course of trade for constituting any infringement. In the instant case, the situation seems to be entirely different because the trade mark partially owned by the plaintiff has not been used, as yet, therefore, there is no question of infringement by the defendants in the course of trade.
10. A careful examination of the record reveals that the instant suit has been filed only on account of signing of an agreement between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 and the stage of use of the trade mark has not yet reached. According to the contents of the plaint, defendant No.1, who is the joint owner of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" with the plaintiff is assigning the registered trade mark to defendant No.2 through an agreement dated 01.04.2017 without seeking the approval of plaintiff being the co-owner of the trade mark, in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The plaintiff while considering this action of defendant No.1 as an infringement of his registered trade mark has filed the instant suit. Thus the actual dispute is between co-owners of the trade mark and the plaintiff has filed the instant suit to restrain his co-owner i.e. defendant No.1 from entering into a franchise agreement of the trademark with defendant No.2. This Court has failed to find any express provision in the Trade Marks Ordinance, which prohibits a co-owner of a trade mark to enter into an agreement qua the subject trade mark with anyone else. Similarly, there is no provision in the Ordinance, ibid, which empowers a co-owner to file a suit against the other co-owner qua the issue of infringement. Similarly, there is no denial of the fact that any violation of section 24(5) read with section 69 of the Trade Marks Ordinance falls within the jurisdiction of a District Court under section 117 of the Trade Mark Ordinance and, as such, the Tribunal cannot adjudicate upon a controversy between the co-owners of the trade mark.
11. The next proposition, which boils down for determination is whether a dispute of partnership between the co-owners of a trade mark can be settled by the Tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction within the meaning of section 18 of the IPO Act. This court has carefully attended this aspect of the matter. Prior to the IPO Act 2012 all civil suits/proceedings regarding protection of intellectual property rights were filed before the District Judge under section 117 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The relevant Section of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is reproduced hereunder in verbatim:-
""Suits for infringement to be instituted before District Court. No suit for the infringement of a trade mark or otherwise relating to any right in a trade mark shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.""

JOINT REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES---Respondent
","C.O. No. 25683 of 2019, decided on 8th June, 2020.",Nil,"JAWAD HASSAN, J.","the Petitioner No.1 is a private limited company by shares with an authorized share capital of Rs.200,000,000/- divided into 20,000,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.166,580,040/- divided into 16,658,004 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. Similarly, the Petitioner No.2 is a private limited company by share with an authorized share capital of Rs.2,000,000/- divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.600,000/- divided into 60,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. Conversely, the Petitioner No.3 is a private limited company by share with an authorized share capital of Rs.2,000,000/- divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.600,000/- divided into 60,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each.","The basic requirement of Section 279 of the Companies Act is as follows:
(i) there must be a compromise / arrangement/ Scheme
(ii) proposed between a company and its creditors
(iii) application to be made to the Commission now the High Court, as defined above;
(iv) supported by meetings
(v) mandatory filing of material facts relating to the company which is;
(a) financial position
(b) auditor's report
(c) latest accounts of the company
(d) the pendency of any investigation proceedings
(e) supported by the affidavits
Now moving forward, as highlighted above, the expression 'demerger' is not expressly defined in the Companies Act. Sections 279 to 282 of the Companies Act contain provisions regarding Compromises, Arrangement and Reconstruction. However, it could very well be said that the same is covered under the expression arrangement, as defined in subsection (6) of Section 279 of the Companies Act which reads as follows:
"" .the expression ""arrangement"" includes a re-organization of the share-capital of the company by the consolidation of shares of different classes or by the division of shares into shares of different classes or by both those methods, .""
23. Moreover the term demerger has also not been defined in the Indian Companies Act of 2013 which repealed the Companies Act of 1956. However the term demerger finds mention in subsection (19AA) of Section 2 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. According to the said subsection, demerger in relation to companies, means transfer, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.
","Being a sanctioning Court, I have noticed that all indispensable statutory benchmarks, requirements and formalities have been accomplished and adhered to by the petitioners as envisioned under the relevant provisions of the law, including the holding/convening of the requisite meetings as contemplated under the relevant provisions and rules and the resolutions passed by the members have already been highlighted. The scheme set up for sanction has been reinforced and fortified by the requisite majority which decision seems to be just and fair. The report/minutes of meetings unequivocally convey that all essential and fundamental characteristics and attributes of schemes were placed before the voters at the concerned meetings to live up to statutory obligations. The proposed schemes are not found to be violative of any provision of law and/or contrary to public policy but as a whole looks like evenhanded and serviceable from the point of view of a prudent man of business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by him for whom the scheme is meant. As explained in the above case precedents, once the requirements of a scheme for getting sanction of the court are found to have been met, the court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval of the scheme. There does not remain any objection to the scheme of arrangement and no mistake, conspicuous, detectable shortcoming or flaw has further been pointed out in the present matter before me.
36. In view of the forgoing reasons, there remains no impediment to grant and sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the Scheme attached at Annex-A (sic.) is hereby sanctioned in terms thereof.
","Under the Companies Act and the previous Companies Ordinance, 1984 (the ""Ordinance""), the Courts have allowed mergers by stating where all the requisite formalities were complied with including shareholders' approval, the Court would not question the commercial wisdom behind the scheme. One of the effects of the sanction of the Court is that it becomes binding upon the company and its members including those who voted against the scheme once the scheme of compromise and arrangement is approved by statutory majority it binds the dissenting minority and the company. The Court has the power to give effect to all the incidental and ancillary questions in the effort to satisfy itself whether the scheme has the approval of the requisite majority. It is not the function of the Court to examine whether there is a scope for better scheme. However, where the Court finds that scheme is patently fraudulent, it may not respond or function as mere rubber stamp or post office but reject the scheme of arrangement.
30. Furthermore, in the Indian Supreme Court case of Miheer H. Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. reported in AIR 1997 Supreme Court 506, it was held that the court certainly would not act as a court of appeal and sit in judgment over the informed view of the concerned parties to the compromise as the same would be in the realm of corporate and commercial wisdom of the concerned parties. The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the Scheme by the requisite majority. Consequently the Company Court's jurisdiction to that extent is peripheral and supervisory and not appellate.
31. Based on the jurisprudence in Company Law developed by Pakistani, English and Indian cases, discussed above, and in light of the applicable sections of the Companies Act, the Court acts like an umpire in a game of cricket who has to see that both the teams play their game according to the rules and do not overstep the limits. The propriety and the merits of the compromise or arrangement have to be judged by the parties who as sui juris with their open eyes and fully informed about the pros and cons of the Scheme arrive at their own reasoned judgment and agree to be bound by such compromise or arrangement.

","Civil Original No. 1161 of 2015, decided on 10th December, 2018.","10th December, 2018.","SHAHID KARIM, J.","The facts are simple and may be stated shortly. The parties are on common ground with regard to a substantial portion of the facts. The applicant is a company registered under the laws of Kingdom of Thailand and is a global distributor of the world's leading cosmetics brands including but not limited to Tellme, Nature Bright, Sunway. Lawland, Effi'n, Elfi'. Promina cover Art and Arche'. The applicant is a worldwide agent of Arche products and its various brands of cosmetics which include Arche' Pure Thai Pearl Cream, Arche' White and Brite, Arche' White Pearl Cream etc. Paragraph 4 of the petition gives a list of the countries and the detail of the registration of Arche trade mark in the name of the applicant. In short, the applicant is the exclusive owner of the trade mark `Arche' and on this basis establishes its right over the intellectual property relating to Arche. The respondent No.3 is the authorized agent of the applicant in Pakistan and is responsible for marketing, selling or exporting its products in Pakistan. The applicant in its capacity as the exclusive owner of the intellectual property in Arche products applied for the registration of the trade mark 'Arche' in Pakistan on 11.05.1973 in respect of perfumery, lotions and other cosmetic goods falling in Class-3. The Registrar Trade Mark, Pakistan registered the following trade mark having registration No.58907 in the name of the applicant w.e.f. 11.05.1973:
 
5. The trade mark was renewed from time to time and lastly according to the contents of the application, w.e.f. 11.05.2009 for a period of ten years and continued to be registered in the name of the applicant till date. According to the applicant, vide application dated 26.3.2014 the applicant has further applied for the registration of trade marks for various other products in Class-3 and the process of registration of the trade marks is pending with the respondent No.2. During this time, the applicant became aware of the fact regarding registration of identical trade mark by Hamza for cosmetics products which is similar to the earlier trade mark of the applicant and resembles the said trade mark in material particular. The trade mark of Hamza was registered as trade mark No.247291 in Class-3 on 7.8.2014 w.e.f. 3.3.2008. The following is the pictorial depiction of the trade mark registered in the name of Hamza:
","This application under section 80 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance, 2001) seeks the invalidation of the entry in Trade Marks Register regarding the Trade Mark No.247291 dated 03.03.2008 in Class-3 (""The Trade Mark""). The said trade mark belongs to respondent No.1 (trading as Hamza Cosmetics) (hereinafter, Hamza). In a nub, the case of the applicant is that the registration of the trade mark be declared invalid on the ground that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001. Primarily the declaration of invalidity has been sought or the ground of section 80(3)(a) and (b) which provide that:
""Grounds for invalidity of registration.-
(3) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground that there is-
(a) an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions set out in subsections (1), (2) or (3) of section 17 obtain: or
(b) an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out in subsection (4) of section 17 is satisfied, unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right has consented to the registration.
","During the course of the hearing the original record was produced by the office of the Registrar which shows the application of the trade mark made on 3.3.2008. A show cause notice was issued under section 27 of the Ordinance, 2001 to Hamza with specific reference to the trade mark registered in favour of the applicant priorly and on the basis of earlier conflicting trade mark. It cannot be gleaned from the record as to whether these proceedings culminated in an order passed by the Registrar or not. Be that as it may, the trade mark was registered ultimately and for whose invalidity the instant proceedings have been brought by the applicant.
19. In view of the above, this application is allowed. Trade mark registration No.247291 dated 3.3.2008 is declared invalid under the provisions of section 80(1) read with sections 14 and 14(4) of the Ordinance, 2001, and is struck off the Register of Trade Marks.
The original record which was retained with the Court Associate of this Court vide order dated 13.11.2018 is handed over to the representative of the Trade Mark Department present in the Court.
","Thus, according to the portion quoted in Jamia Industries Ltd., marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollect of the whole. Moreover, variations in details might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own. Also while determining whether a mark bears resemblance to another mark and is likely to deceive, the underlying rule is to determine by considering what is the leading characteristic of each of these marks.
13. The marks of both, the applicant as well as Hamza, have been reproduced above and there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the two marks resemble each other to such an extent that they are likely to deceive the mind of an unwary customer who will have to rely upon the leading characteristic of the mark of the applicant which characteristics are also comprised in and are part of the mark registered in the name of Hamza. Upon a visual comparison too the two marks are identical to each other and the mark registered in the name of Hamza has been registered for goods similar to those for which the earlier trade mark of the applicant was registered.
14. To reiterate the real question to decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon an average mind of ordinary intelligence would look to a particular trade mark and what impression he would form by looking at the trade mark. Applying the aforesaid principles to the instant case, not only visual appearance of the two marks are similar but they also relate to the same products and thus an average mind of ordinary intelligence would consider the goods of Hamza as that of the applicant. Thus, the registration in the name of Hamza is likely to deceive or confuse the customers. Also the applicant is the exclusive user of the mark not only in Pakistan but equally in other countries and has acquired the proprietorship of the mark and lays a rightful claim to the intellectual property of the said mark.

3. Respondent No.1 (Messrs Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.) Limited) a company incorporated in Pakistan under the Companies Ordinance 1984, Manufacturers, Merchants, Importers and Exporters, opposed the registration of Trade Mark ""AHMED TEA"" advertised under application No.149770 Class-30 in the Trade Marks Journal No.632, on the grounds that they have for many years carried on a reputable business in Pakistan and outside the country as manufacturers, merchants, importer and exporters of wide range of products falling in Class-29, 30 and 32; that they are well known all over the country and in every part of the world due to huge exports of food items and other allied goods; having overseas offices, manufacturing companies in a number of countries and have local agents and distributors; that the trademark use by them in respect of its aforesaid business is AHMED which besides being its principal world famous trademark is also its house mark; that word Ahmed also forms a part of their corporate name Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd; that trademark AHMED was first adopted and used by them in the year 1952 and is continuously in use since then and is presently used on a large number of foods items; that in view of the good quality of products and intensive publicity campaigns, the trademark AHMED has exclusively become associated with them throughout the world including Pakistan and in order to protect their rights and interest in that trademark they have applied for registration in almost all the territories of the world. However, the appellants had applied for legistration of trademark AHMED TEA with prior knowledge of the popularity and reputation of the trademark AHMED of respondent No.1 and with a view to trade upon the goodwill and reputation of respondent No.1 in the above trademark; that respondent No.1 are of the definite opinion that the use of the impugned trademark AHMED TEA by appellants would lead to the two marks being confused with each other and would create confusion and deception amongst the consumers and would give monetary and goodwill loss to the respondent No.1; that the application filed by appellants before respondent No.2 was clearly an attempt to trade unfairly upon the reputation and goodwill of respondent No.1 and to deceive the public into believing that the goods bearing trademark AHMED TEA emanates from respondent No.1 or from person having, business association with respondent No.1 and that likelihood of deception and confusion as to trade origin or trade connection is more serious because the goods are of the same description and are used and purchased by same class of purchasers through same trade channel; that appellants aforesaid trademark AHMED TEA is objectionable under sections 10(1) and 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, by reason of its being likely to deceive or to cause confusion; also appellants mark if used would be disentitled to protection in a court of justice under section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940.","""whether a registration under the law alone is sufficient to take a control over such trade?""
""whether the applicant's application No.149770 in class-30 should be refused registration?""","Prima facie, the order impugned was/is in line with all settled principles and is not open to any exception. Accordingly, same is maintained. Appeal is dismissed.","The purpose of registration is nothing but to ensure a protection to the goodwill, name and reputation of a 'trade-mark' so as to avoid any mala fide move of other competitor to come and take the benefit of such name and reputation of the `mark' which, undoubtedly, is not established in a day nor can it be achieved over-night.
The registration of person in the register of proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation of those goods and that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person, who not being the proprietor of the trade mark of a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembles it as to likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered.

The respondent No.1 is authorized user of the mark 'AHMED'; the respondent No.1. has been using the mark 'AHMED' since 1952; the respondent No.1's mark 'AHMED' is registered in both classes i.e '29 and 30' of fourth schedule; dealing with goods of such classes both nationally and internationally.
The appellant has applied for registration of 'AHMED' as it 'mark'; the registration of such 'mark' is for class '30'; A bare look at mark of appellant cannot be said to be dissimilar to that of trade mark of the respondent No.1 i.e 'AHMED' for reading and even is phonetically identical.
since the 'tea' will be sold from one and same counter wherefrom goods of the respondent No.1 shall be sold because it has no where, been claimed by the appellant that respondent No.1 sells its goods at its own 'outlet'. Further, it is also not the case of the appellant that the goods of appellant i.e 'tea' shall be offered/sold to some other class of public therefore, prima facie, the Registrar was quite right in refusing the registration of the mark of the appellant in 'class-30'.

","M.A. No. 11 of 2006, decided on 11th November, 2019.","27th May, 2019.","SYED HASAN AZHAR RIZVI, J.","The brief facts of this case are that the appellant is a private limited company incorporated in Pakistan. The dispute involves ownership rights of trademark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan in respect to Class 16 of the international classification of goods. The parent organization of the appellant, Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO), introduced public survey and public opinions research in Pakistan. PIPO and its affiliate organization Gallup Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited and the appellant are the only members of Gallup International Association in Pakistan and are the exclusive users of trade mark GALLUP in Pakistan till to date. In 1981, PIPO became the exclusive Associate Member of Gallup International in Pakistan. In 1984, PIPO became the exclusive full member of Gallup International in Pakistan and PIPO and its affiliates have been consistently using the trademark GALLUP and Gallup Pakistan together with Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion since at least 1981. Gallup Pakistan has been existing for nearly forty years and has been the exclusive user of the trade mark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan. The joint names of Gallup Pakistan and Gallup Organization in the International Gallup Directories illustrate that respondent No. 2 never claimed any right for use of name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan nor objected to the use of the said name by the appellant and its affiliates in Pakistan. Respondent No. 2 accepted throughout the right of Gallup Pakistan to use the name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan exclusively. The appellant on 07.5.1994 filed an Application No. 124363 for registration of its trademark ""GALLUP"" in Class 16 and the application was accepted for advertisement. Respondent No. 2 filed Opposition No. 56 of 1999 alleging that it was the proprietor of Trade Mark ""GALLUP"" and also disclosed pendency of its Application No. 129970 dated 02.5.1995 for registration of same mark in same class. Respondent No. 2 has failed to file a single document showing use of the name ""Gallup"" by them in Pakistan. The appellant filed a counter statement to the opposition along with documentary evidence and affidavit supporting such counter statement. Respondent No. 2 never filed any reply or rejoinder to the counter-statement of the appellant. The contents of the appellant's counter statement therefore remain un-rebutted till date.","""Who is the proprietor of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan?""
""Whether use of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan by the Appellant would entitle it to secure registration in its name?""
""Whether the adoption of the trademark 'Gallup' by Applicant constitutes honest concurrent user?""","After taking into account evidence about the long history of the GIA, domestic courts in these and many other countries came to recognize that Respondent No. 2 is just a rich American corporation which is trying to unfairly bag the fruits of the labor of independent scholars from all over the world.""
""Therefore, the plea of the appellant that since presently the respondent No.1 is not dealing in 'tea-product' hence registration of its mark 'AHMAD LOAD TEA' shall cause no harm to respondent No.1 is misconceived.""
""As regard another plea of the appellant that since respondent No.1 has not objected/opposed to grant of mark 'AHMED' in class-30 to other entity 'AHMED TEA COMPANY, PESHAWAR' hence respondent No.1 cannot object / oppose the application of the appellant, it would suffice to say that such plea alone cannot prevail over the rights, created by section 29(4) of the Ordinance to every such application nor legally mere negligence in making proper opposition to some earlier application can be a ground to deprive the authorized user from those rights and privileges which are the creation of the law itself.""","Mr. Ijaz Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the impugned order has been passed without taking into consideration the fact that the appellant is the exclusive user of trademark ""Gallup"" in Pakistan, which is established by admitted documents. He has further argued that it is an established fact that the name of the appellant or its parent organization has appeared several times in Gallup International Directories along with and to the knowledge of respondent No.2. He has also argued that respondent No.2's use of this trademark anywhere else in the world is irrelevant as respondent No.2 has failed to prove any work carried out by them in Pakistan. He has urged that the entire project of Gallup Pakistan was started by Dr. Ijaz Shafi Gilani upon encouragement of Dr. Gallup since 1978. He has also urged that Dr. Gallup and scholars from their respective countries established ""The International Association of Public Opinions Institutes"" which was later converted into ""Gallup International Research Institutes and thereafter Gallup International Association was incorporated, which took over the business of Gallup International Research Institutes and Gallup International only makes one member in every country, these members also had the right to use the name ""Gallup"" in Dr. Gallup's own life time as well as afterwards. He has argued that the Appellant is honest, concurrent user in terms of international usage and reputation of the trademark ""Gallup"".
Learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the impugned order is a non-speaking order and does not contain any reasoning at all for arriving at the conclusion. It merely reproduces the contention of the parties and nothing more as the only discussion made by the Registrar does not contain any reasoning and completely ignores the evidence produced by the appellant. He has urged that Registrar has failed to mention a single document filed by the appellant. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed by completely ignoring the relevant facts and evidence. In this regard he made reference to Section 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 clearly states that disputed issues relating to title of a trademark cannot be decided without proper evidence.",MH/G-45/Sindh Appeal allowed.,Allowed
Competition Commission of Pakistan,"Before Dr. Muhammad Saleem, Dr. Shahzad Ansar and Ms. Bushra Naz Malik, Members
Messrs SUKKUR TESTING SERVICES (SMC-PVT.) LIMITED
","F. No. 336 / SIBA(V)STS / OFT / CCP / 2018, decided on 12th February, 2020.","12th February, 2020.",nil,"The Complainant filed a complaint against the Respondent. The Commission upon receipt of the Complaint initiated an enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act. The principle allegation in the Complaint was that the Respondent is disseminating false and misleading information to consumers through advertisements in various newspapers, claiming to be Testing Service Provider in the name and style of ""Sukkur Testing Service (STS)"", which graphically resembles to the Complainant as ""SIBA Testing Service (STS)"" and consequently damaging the Complainant's reputation, which is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant.
The SCN served to the Respondent was returned undelivered with the remarks of the courier ""Shifted"". The office of Registrar contacted the Respondent telephonically and directed to receive the SCN personally. The Respondent received the SCN and filed written reply on 10th February 2020. ","However based on the submissions raised by the Complainant and the Respondent, we deem it appropriate to address the following issue: Whether the Respondent has resorted to the deceptive marketing practices in violation of section 10 of the Act?","For the reasons discussed above and in line with our mandate to protect the consumers from anti-competitive behavior, including deceptive marketing practices, we hereby hold the subject conduct of the Respondent has violated provisions of section 10(1) of the Act read with section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
38. We are cognizant of the fact that marketers traditionally focus on designing advertising campaigns and other promotional strategies to promote a brand name. However, with evolving consumer preferences and laws, presentation; trade dress have become just as essential for making products and services distinctive and for building brand recall. The cultural diversity of the Pakistan market makes a compelling case for the importance of product identification by packaging and visual impression. This has resulted in third parties creating lookalikes of popular products with similar packaging or offer services through similar logos in order to grab consumers' attention and generate demand for their own products/services in the market. In our considered view, the consumers are clearly susceptible and at a serious risk of falling prey to deceptive confusion pertaining to the origin and quality of the products, due to the striking similarity in the Complainant's logo and the logo used by the Respondent.
39. In the instant matter it is on record that the Respondent had only published one advertisement i.e. the Impugned Advertisement, the last date to file application thereof was 26th November 2018. Thereafter, no further advertisements were issued by the Respondent. The Complaint was filed on 28th January 2019 and in the Enquiry Report it is also acknowledged that no other advertisement was published by the Respondent. It is on the record that the proprietor of Respondent discontinued the business through Respondent. The Respondent after the hearing in the matter has also submitted its Bank statement for the period 27th June 2018 to 12th February 2020 titled Sukkur Testing Services (SMC-PVT) Limited at Habib Bank Branch G-10 Markaz, Islamabad. From examination of advertisement and bank statement it is evident the advertisement was published in the newspapers on November 2018 and the last date of forms submission of fee was 26th November 2018. The Respondent received the fee amounting to Rs. 50, 150, 250, 300 and 450 from students for seven different posts mentioned in the advertisement. Till 26th November 2018 its account balance was Rs. 556,140.00/, The Respondent has clarified that the amount of Rs. 500,000/- (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) was returned to the Public Sector Organization and the Bank Statement shows the withdrawal of the said amount also. During the hearing the Respondent had also submitted that he is willing to comply with the directions and he will not indulge in any illegal practices in future. It is also relevant that Complainant though had claimed during the hearing that prospective consumers approached them, however, no evidence in this regard was produced before us. Further, even in the Complaint's paras (5) and (6) there is no mention that the prospective candidates approached them upon seeing the advertisement.
40. Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Act, however, the approach of the representative of the Respondent needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and the Respondent discontinued the violation during the enquiry and never repeated that violation of the Act. In addition he also apologized and assured future compliance of the Act in letter and spirit. We, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 250,000/- (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, given Respondent is directed to deposit the penalty with the Commission in two equal instalments within ninety (90) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is also reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Act.
41. In terms of the above, the Show Cause Notice No. 01 of 2020 dated 17th January 2020 is hereby disposed of.
","The concept of Consumer vis- -vis section 10 of the Act: It is clear that under the Act, the Commission is mandated to protect the consumers from anti-competitive practices prohibited. One of such practice is deceptive marketing practices, which is aimed at the consumers to make a transactional decision, Hence, it is important to determine the consumer for the purpose of assessment under section 10 of the Act. 
The concept of False or Misleading information in the process of advertising/marketing: Subsequent to understanding and clarifying the concept of Consumer, we are of the considered opinion that, it must be understood, what constitutes 'false' or 'misleading' information in the process of advertising/marketing which evokes a violation of section 10 of the Act. 
Net General Impression of the Impugned Advertisement: The third and most important aspect in order to record our findings vis-a-vis the violation of prohibition contained in section 10 of the Act, is to gather the impression of the advertisement/marketing campaign impugned. The Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e. Order in the matter of China Mobile Pak Limited and Pakistan Telecom Mobile Limited reported as 2010 CLD 1478, has held that:
""...evaluate complete advertisement and make an opinion regarding deception [...] on the basis of net general impression conveyed by them and not an isolated script"".
Material Information: With reference to the materiality of the representation, reference can be made to the FTC Policy Statement on Deception dated 14.10.1983 appended to Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 174 (1984), wherein it is provided that the commission, omission, or practice must be a 'material' one which is likely to affect the consumer's conduct or decision with regard to a product or service. This was also endorsed by the Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e., Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zone and Ufone reported as 2010 CLD 1478.
28. We take into account the overall net general impression of the Impugned Advertisement, we cannot ignore the fact that similar acronym used by the Respondent might confuse the Consumers/ prospective candidates about the goodwill and status of the Testing Service. Hence, we are of the opinion that the Respondent by using the similar acronym is in fact passing off its services and misleading the consumers about its association with the Complainant.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, using of similar acronym by the Respondent gives the Consumers an impression that either the Impugned Advertisement is issued by the Complainant or the Respondent is somehow associated or affiliated with the Complainant. Further, the word `Sukkur' also can confuse the consumers about the information disseminated through the Impugned Advertisement that the services being offered to attract prospective candidates are by the Complainant. In response we note that the Respondent has not provided any evidence which substantiate that the Respondent is associated with the Complainant. Further, the use of similar acronym and words Sukkur in the Impugned Advertisement seems to be a conscious attempt by the Respondent to capitalize on the goodwill and standing of the Complainant. Hence, we are of the considered view that in the instant matter a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(b) is made out.
31. Fraudulent Use of Trademark: With reference to the fraudulent use of trademark, it is on the record that the Complainant had applied for registration of trademark in the name and style of ""SIBA Testing Services"" vide application dated 22nd February, 2019 i.e. even after filing the Complaint with the Commission. We are also conscious of the fact that the trademark is not registered in favour of any of the parties. Although the Complainant, from the material available on the record, is a prior user; however, the ownership is yet to be conferred by the Trademarks Registry under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
We are cognizant of the fact that the scope of proceedings under section 10 of the Act is restricted only to the extent of deceptive marketing practices. We are not conferred with the power by the legislature to determine the right to ownership of any undertakings vis- -vis the trademark. The assessment in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act i.e. fraudulent use of another's trademark, can only be carried out where the ownership is granted or acquired under any law i.e. the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, a similar situation exists in the instant matter, as the trademark is not registered in the name of either party, hence, any findings vis-a-vis the ownership of the trademark would be beyond the scope of section 10 of the Act and would be construed as encroaching upon the domain of Trademark Registrar under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, we are of the considered view that a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act cannot be proved in the instant matter.
. Information Capable of Harming the Business Interest of other undertakings: Now turning to section 10(2)(a) of the Act, according to which 'the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. We are guided by one of Commission's earlier Order i.e. Order dated 21st December, 2012 in the matter of Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd, 2013 CLD 1014, wherein the Commission had observed that ""it is important to recognize that part of any business' identity is the goodwill it has established with consumers, while part of a product's identity is the reputation it has earned for quality and value"". We are also guide by, Order dated 17 March 2015 in the matter of M/S Jotun Pakistan (Pvt) Limited, 2015 CLD 1638, the Commission had held that ""To prove conduct under section 10(2)(a) of the Act, it is not necessary to show actual harm to competitors. It is sufficient to show the existence of a deceptive marketing practice that has the potential to harm the business interests of the competitors."" (emphasis added).
It is also pertinent to mention that in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act read with 10(2)(b) or (c) or (d) of the Act, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out. The consequence of the distribution of information to the public that is false or misleading is that it is capable of harming the business interests of and resulting in fatal consequences for the competitors of the undertaking making such deceptive claims. It may also be clarified at this point that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than the other sub-sections of section 10(2). It was observed by the Commission in its Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs A. Rahim Foods {Private) Limited, 2016 CLD 1128, that ""While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section I0(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise"". The same rationale is applicable to Section 10(2)(b) of the Act, as it is to section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

SAMSONITE IP HOLDINGS S.a.r.l. through Attorney and another---Plaintiffs
Versus
FAMOUS BRANDS (PVT.) LIMITED---Defendant

","Suit No. 2040 of 2017, decided on 24th July, 2018.","16th, 29th March, 19th April and 10th May, 2018.","MUHAMMAD JUNAID GHAFFAR, J.","All three listed applications are being dealt with and decided through this common order. Application at serial Nos. 1 and 2 have been filed on behalf of the Defendant under Order VII, Rules 10 and 11, Civil Procedure Code (""C.P.C.""), whereas, application at serial No. 3 is under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. filed on behalf of the Plaintiff seeking an injunction against the Defendant.

This is a Suit for Declaration, Permanent Injunction and Damages being sought against the Defendant for allegedly infringing their trademark as well as passing-off the same by selling such goods as a licensed vendor under the name and style of Plaintiff's trademark. This Suit has been filed on behalf of two Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff No.1 is a company governed and registered under the laws of Luxembourg, whereas, Plaintiff No.2 is a company incorporated under the laws of United Arab Emirates. It is claimed that Plaintiffs jointly own and are authorized to the exclusive use of the registered trademarks of their companies under the name and style of ""SAMSONITE"" Group for trademarks which includes but are not limited to, 'SAMSONITE' 'AMERICAN TOURISTER' and 'HIGH SIERRA' (relevant for the present purposes), in addition to various other trademarks as well. It is their claim that Samsonite brands are known as the world's largest and most recognizable brands of luggage, bags and other related items.

",I have heard both the learned Counsel and perused the record. Facts have been briefly stated hereinabove and it appears that the Plaintiffs claim and hold Intellectual Property Rights of various trademarks such as 'SAMSONITE' 'AMERICAN TOURISTER' and 'HIGH SIERRA' which are relevant for the present dispute. The Plaintiff No. 1 is presently the company which owns the entire business of the Samsonite group including various trademarks worldwide. To that effect trademark registration certificates of various brands in International Jurisdiction under Class 18 and 35 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services have been placed on record and do not appear to be in dispute. ,"Insofar as the applicability of section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is concerned, it provides that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if such person uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered. The primary consideration provided therein is that the Trademark of which infringement is being alleged, must necessarily be ""registered"". And in case it is not registered, then at least claim of infringement is not maintainable, but a claim of passing-off can always be pressed upon, subject to the parameters prescribed for entertaining such claim. Here there are several trademarks in question and out of such only one of the said trademarks is registered and i.e. ""American Tourister Word"" in class 18 against application No. 81872. The other marks in question as mentioned in Para 6 above are either pending or publication has been made in the Trade Mark Journal; but admittedly they are not registered as yet. Hence, in the given circumstances, it is only one trademark as above for which infringement could be pressed upon in terms of the Ordinance. For rest of the marks, at the most, it is only a case of passing-off which could be pressed upon. As to sections 85 and 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, admittedly Pakistan is a signatory to the Paris Convention and TRIPs for the protection of industrial property as revised and amended from time to time and in view of such signing of the treaty the legislature has enacted section 86 giving protection to well-known trademarks. Subsection (2) thereof provides that the Tribunal (Court) while determining whether a trade mark is well-known, without having to require registration or actual use in the form of sale of goods or services under the trade mark in Pakistan, shall consider the factors provided therein as a relevant criteria for establishing the well-known status of the trade mark in question. It empowers the Court to make determination without requiring registration and or use of such mark in Pakistan and could be either in relation to goods or services, as the case may be. Learned Counsel for the Defendant while controverting the claim of the plaintiffs in respect of applicability of Section 86 ibid had made a submission that this is only relevant for the purposes of deciding an application for registration of a trademark by the Registrar and cannot be considered in a claim of injunction. However, with respect I am unable to agree with such stance. The law discussed hereinabove is clear in terms and subsection (2) of section 86 ibid, provides that it is not necessary that for having protection of this nature a mark must necessarily be registered; and subsection (3) further provides that the owner of a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention as a well-known mark, shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Pakistan of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical or deceptively similar to the well-known trade mark. In fact it the other way round; and has been mandated to give protection to well-known marks, who are not even registered or in use in Pakistan; but are well known and registered worldwide. Though not necessarily required in view of no defence to the fact that Samsonite is a mark of world recognition and is in use in Pakistan on behalf of the plaintiffs, as well as claim of registration going on without opposition; it may be observed, that it is not in dispute with a serious degree of contention that Samsonite Corporation was established in the year 1910 and perhaps is the world's largest travel luggage company. 
After having perused the record before me and in the light of the above information and for the fact that nothing has been put in defence as to the claim of the plaintiffs that their marks are well-known, except that this protection only applies while seeking registration of a trademark (which I have already disagreed with), here in this case the three trademarks of the Plaintiffs in question including the trademark Samsonite in my view falls within well-known marks as defined under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance read with the definition so provided in the Paris Convention. I have already discussed hereinabove as to what constitutes a well-known mark under the Paris Convention to which Pakistan is already a signatory, whereas, corresponding legislation in the form of sections 85 and 86 in the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, is already in place. Therefore, in this situation when the law itself waives the condition of being registered as against requirement of section 40 ibid, denying a Trade Mark holder, the benefit of such protection of infringement/injunction would be against the law. It is a matter of legal right and must not be denied ordinarily. In fact nothing has been pleaded on behalf of the Defendant to the effect that the trademarks in question including Samsonite is not a well-known mark; therefore, in the given facts and circumstances the Plaintiffs case for a restraining order through an injunctive relief merits consideration under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 notwithstanding the fact that except one; other trademarks are not yet registered.

In these circumstances, the applications at serial Nos. 1 and 2 are dismissed whereas, the application at serial No. 3 is allowed in the above terms.

","Before proceeding further on merits of the injunction application, firstly I would like to deal with the two applications of the Defendant under Order VII, Rules 10 and 11, C.P.C. Both these applications have been filed simultaneously seeking return and or rejection of the Plaint. The precise ground taken in the application under Order VII, Rule 10, C.P.C. is to the effect that the relationship and or terms and conditions between the parties were being handled at Lahore, whereas, the head office of the Defendant is also in Lahore, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction. It has been further stated that various litigations are already pending in the Lahore Jurisdiction and therefore, on this ground also this Court has no jurisdiction. However, I may observe that Defendant is admittedly operating an office in Karachi as well as retail shops within Karachi and the present dispute and cause of action so stated on behalf of the Plaintiffs is to the effect that after termination of the relationship, the Defendant is still using and pretending to be an authorized reseller by displaying the logo of Samsonite on the signboards in and outside its shops. Hence, in view of such position, I am of the view that this is a separate and independent cause of action and the alleged cause falls within the jurisdiction of this Court; hence, the plaint cannot be returned merely on this ground. 
Insofar as the injunction application bearing C.M.A. No.12935/2017 is concerned, the Plaintiff's case primarily is that after termination of the relationship with the Defendant, whereby, the Defendant was permitted to act as a distributor and reseller, the Defendant is no more authorized to sell goods bearing the Plaintiffs trademarks. The ground for such prayer is based on the premise that firstly, the trademarks in question belonging to the Plaintiffs are well known marks as defined in the Paris Convention as well as under sections 85 and 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. Secondly, the contention is that certain marks are already registered and are protected under section 40 of the Ordinance ibid, whereas, the remaining marks have already been applied for and in some cases the assignment deeds are pending, but notwithstanding the pendency of the assignment deeds, these marks belong to the Plaintiffs and the act of Defendant tantamount to infringement as defined under section 40 of the Ordinance, 2001. It is also the case of the Plaintiff's that such act of the Defendant also amounts to passing-off the Plaintiffs goods. For the purposes of injunction, it is the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant is using the ""Samsonite"" signage on its retail shops. 
The need to protect well-known marks was discussed amongst member countries of the Paris Convention in 1920, which resulted in the aforesaid Article. This Article places all member states under obligation either to reject/cancel the registration, or prohibit the use, of trademarks which are confusingly similar to a well-known mark. This protection was originally available only for trademarks relating to goods, not services. However, countries belonging to Paris Convention were not prevented from extending the protection to services. This Article at times was noted and considered to be extremely insufficient, and since 1995 World Intellectual Property Organization (""WIPO"") had been advocating for a separate treaty for its protection in more clear terms. Thereafter in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (more commonly known as ""TRIPS-agreement""), Article 6 of the Paris Convention has been improved to a great extent, by incorporating Article 16 in the following terms;

Well-known trademarks are to be protected for services as well as products. The protection extends beyond just similarity to situations where use of the trademark would indicate a connection between the product/service and the owner of the well-known trademark, and could cause detriment to the trademark owner.

Account must be taken of knowledge of the relevant sector of the public i.e. the mark needs to be famous in relation to the goods and services where its use is likely to cause confusion.

RANI AND COMPANY and 2 others---Respondents

","High Court Appeal No. 359 of 2018, decided on 13th March, 2019.","18th, 25th January, 1st and 28th February, 2019.","AGHA FAISAL, J.","The salient features of the controversy are that the appellant claims to have been using trademark Rami since 2008 and has at least eight (08) variant trademarks registered in such regard and further that the said trademark, with its color and label, are also stated to be registered as copyright protected works in the Central Copyright Office of Pakistan. The record demonstrates that the appellant has been using its branding since 2008, however, the earliest registration of its trademark took place in 2014. The respondent No. 1 has instituted opposition proceedings there against before the Registrar and in the said proceedings numerous hearings were held and after leading of evidence the matter was fixed for final hearing. The record reflects that the final notice for hearing in the opposition proceedings was issued by the Registrar on 25.08.2017.","We have heard the respective learned counsel and have carefully considered the documentations arrayed before us. It is pertinent to record at the very onset that it is not the purview of this Court to determine any claim or opposition with respect to the trademarks of the parties herein. The only point for determination before us is whether during the pendency of appropriate proceedings before the Registrar, and during pendency of the Suit itself, the appellant could be restrained from using its registered trademark by virtue of an order passed in an interim application.","In view of the foregoing, and with utmost respect to the learned Single Judge, it is concluded that the Impugned Order is not sustainable, hence, the same, is hereby set aside. As a consequence hereof C.M.A. 13341 of 2017 stands revived to the stage where it was prior to 27.09.2017 and the said application may be de novo determined by a learned Single Judge in accordance with the law after providing due opportunity to the parties to be heard.
12. The appeal is allowed in terms herein contained.
","There is no cavil to the factum that the proceedings challenging/ opposing the respective trademark was validly instituted by the respondent No. 1 against the appellant before the Registrar. It has also not been denied that the entire proceedings are at the stage of final hearing after conclusion of the evidence recorded therein. The learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 had expressly stated that the Suit was instituted as the respondent No. 1 had lost confidence in the person holding the office of the Registrar at the said time. It was also admitted by the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 that the said person is no longer in office as he has been succeeded by the present incumbent, against whom there is no ostensible objection. While we do not appreciate the levelling of unsubstantiated allegations impeaching the character of a public office holder, however, the said objection, even if considered, does not subsist any longer as the learned counsel has admitted that the person in respect whereof there were reservations is no longer holding the same office. We do not consider it appropriate to dilate further upon this issue as it is for the learned Single Judge to determine whether the proceedings in the Suit and those before the Registrar could mutually coexist or otherwise.
7. The objections and counter objections with regard to the registered trademarks of the contesting parties herein is also not dilated upon as the said issues are validly pending before the Registrar and also have a direct nexus with the Suit. The question of interim relief under similar circumstances was the subject of scrutiny before this Court as manifest from the Judgment titled Aldo Group International AG v. Aldo Shoes reported as 2016 CLD 229. Under similar circumstances Munib Akhtar, J. had denied the grant of interim relief and observed as follows:
""Having considered this material, I am of the view that the plaintiff may well be unable to make out a case of either the balance of convenience being in its favour or that it will suffer irreparable loss and injury. Hence two of three ""ingredients"" for interim relief may be missing in the present context. However, I expressly do not record any finding on this point at this stage. Furthermore, there is again the complication of the parties' respective pending applications in respect of registration under class 25. If the defendant is able to obtain registration of its mark, it would be able to sell its shoes using that mark. It would be incongruous in such a situation that it would not at the same time be able to use what would then be its registered mark also as part of its trade name. In my view therefore a consideration of the claim of alleged infringement on the basis of section 40(5) should, in the exercise of the Court's discretion, also be deferred till after a determination of the pending applications in respect of class 25"".
8. It is patently evident that the contesting parties herein are the recorded holders of trademarks, hence, entitled to all the rights and privileges appurtenant thereto inclusive without limitation of the rights conferred by section 39 of The Ordinance, which inter alia demarcates a registered trademark to be the personal property of its holder. While the law contains provisions for recall or invalidation of rights conferred, such an action could only take place after adjudication before the proper forum prescribed in such regard. A person cannot be deprived of his property and/or denied the benefit of his property without due process of law and in the present circumstances the appellant has been denied the benefit of its property while the due process of the law remains to be concluded.
9. The Impugned Order records in paragraph 1 thereof that the controversy there before was the allegation that the packaging employed by the appellant was similar to that of the respondent No. 1 and in such regard the respondent No. 1 had claimed infringement of its rights. The Impugned Order also records that the appellant's trademark was registered. The operative constituent of the Impugned Order, while making observations with regard to the similarity of the wrappers, inter alia declared the trademark Rami to be deceptively similar to the trademark of the respondent No. 1 and consequently restrained the appellant from using its registered trademark. It is clear from the bare perusal of the aforesaid order that the issue of similar wrappers was mutually exclusive to the issue of the two registered trademarks. The learned Single Judge while deciding an interim application proceeded to declare the trademark of the appellant deceptively similar to that of the respondent No. 1 despite the fact that the proceedings for this very determination were not only pending before Registrar but also before the learned Single Judge in the Suit itself. In this regard it is observed that not only was the determination premature but it was prima facie disjunctive to the finding of the competing wrappers appearing similar.
10. An interim order, pursuant to Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, is intended to be a preventive or prophylactic remedy for the purposes of preserving the status quo or preserving the corpus of the litigation pending the final determination thereof. Reliance is placed in such regard upon the pronouncements of the superior Courts in Islamic Republic of Pakistan and others v. Zaman Khan and others reported as 1997 SCMR 1508 and Rahat Khan v. Tahir Naveed reported as 2009 CLC 433. The Impugned Order does not preserve the corpus of the litigation and on the contrary it grants the final relief at an interim stage conferring unjustifiable entitlement without such rights ever having been adjudicated by the forum initially seized of the lis, being the Registrar, or even in the Suit itself.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and others---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28 of 2007, 6, 27, 81 of 2008 and 1 of 2009, decided on 25th July, 2018.","25th April, 2018.","KAUSAR SULTANA HUSSAIN, J.","Succinct the case of the appellant is that they filed applications before Registrar Trade Marks in accordance with the provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1940 and the Rules framed in pursuant to such Act, referred as Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963, such application were submitted prior to 12.04.2004 which is the date of coming into force of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, which was though promulgated on 14.04.2001, however in terms of section 1(3), the Ordinance had to take effect from a date to be notified in Official Gazette as reproduced below:-
(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

","Suit No. 20 and C.M.A. No. 83 of 2018, decided on 8th October, 2018.",nil,nil,"The Defendant, through the instant application, challenged the grant of an Ad Interim Injunction which had restrained the Defendant, its agents, representatives, distributors, and employees from using the trademark/trade name ""Brands 4 Less"" and associated logo/artistic work, or from marketing, promoting, trading, and selling products under this trademark/trade name. This challenge is based on the grounds that the Plaintiff has not disclosed any valid cause of action against the Defendant, that factual and legal inaccuracies exist in the Plaintiff’s case, and that pertinent information was withheld to sway the Tribunal. The Defendant asserts prior use of the trademark since 2007-2008 and an attempted registration in 2009, which was abandoned due to lack of legal expertise.","The main issue revolves around whether the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 should be vacated. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff lacks a prima facie case, the balance of convenience does not favor the Plaintiff, and there is no likelihood of irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. The Defendant also asserts prior use and registration attempts for the trademark.","The Tribunal finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated a case for the continuance of the interim injunction. It highlights that owning a well-known mark does not absolve the Plaintiff from proving all necessary elements for injunctive relief. Consequently, the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 is vacated, and the suit is ordered to proceed without the injunction in place.","The Tribunal’s reasoning includes an evaluation of whether all three essential criteria for granting an injunction—prima facie case, balance of convenience, and likelihood of irreparable damage—are met. It reviews the legal standards for granting injunctions, particularly focusing on the principle of ""Dilution"" and whether the Plaintiff’s mark qualifies as a well-known mark under the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001. The Tribunal considers several precedents and legal principles, including the rights of prior users and the requirement that even a well-known mark must satisfy the criteria for irreparable harm and balance of convenience to warrant injunctive relief.",HBT/3/IP/Trib.

","F. No. 279/PC HOTELS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 19th November, 2018.","30th August, 2018.",nil,"the Competition Commission of Pakistan (the 'Commission') vide the Show Cause Notice (the 'SCN') dated 10th July 2018 issued to Messrs Omni Comm (Pvt.) Limited (the 'Respondent') notified that there exists a prima facie case of contravention of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2), section 10(2)(a) and section 10(2)(b) of the Act and called upon to show cause in writing within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt of the SCN and also to appear and place before the Commission the facts and material in support of its contentions either in person or through an authorized representative on 7th August 2018 at the office of the Commission and to explain why an appropriate order under section 31 of the Act may not be passed and/or a penalty for the aforesaid violation may not be imposed under section 38 of the Act.
3. On 16th August 2018, at the first hearing the representative of the Respondent requested for an adjournment as their Counsel was not feeling well and they also presented copy of the order by honourable Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench, Peshawar, in Writ Petition No. 923-A/2018 dated 15th August 2018, restraining the Commission from passing final order in the instant matter, but can proceed with the Show Cause notice. However, no one was present on behalf of Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.) Ltd despite service of notice and intimation by the Registrar of the Commission, therefore, the Bench proceeded ex parte against Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.)

Till the issuance of the final Order and conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act under the SCN, the Respondent and Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.) Limited are directed to refrain from using the trademarks of the Complainant i.e. ""PC"" or ""Pearl Continental""; and
(b) The Respondent is directed not to claim any association or affiliation with the Complainant during the course of its business activities, till the conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act and until further Orders.
18. The Respondent is directed to file the compliance report with reference to the directions given in Para 19 above within seven (7) days from the date of this Order with the Registrar of the Commission, without fail.
Needless to say, the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and without prejudice to further proceedings in the instant proceedings.
20. In terms of the above, the IO Application stands allowed and the Registrar of the Commission is directed to transmit copies of this Order to the concerned parties.
","The Complainant has prayed that the Commission may pass an interim order under section 32 of the Act requiring the Respondents to refrain from displaying the unauthorized/unlicensed use of Complainant's registered mark and logo ""PC""-""Pearl Continental"" or ""PC"" at its premises in contravention of the provisions of the Act including but not limited to recovering any all display boards with the logo ""PC"" and remove the letters ""PC"" from all key chains, hotel menu cards, letter heads, cards and other materials meant for dissemination to customers in line with Section 10.

The Complaints highlight the fact that Respondents are unresponsive to the SCN violating the law and undermining the writ of the Commission. As the Order will take its due course and considerable time. Hence, to prevent the ongoing infringements and deceptive marketing practices the Commission must restrain the Respondents.
c) Continued deceptive marketing practices would cause serious harm to the Complaints as well as the consumers. It is in public interest to stop the unlicensed/unauthorized use of Complainants registered tradename.

Messrs NEUCON PAKISTAN LTD.: In the matter of
","File No. 274/FEROZSONS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 24th September, 2018.","22nd May, 2018.",nil,"The Complainant is a public limited company registered under the law of Pakistan, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing, importing, packaging and selling certain medicinal/ pharmaceutical products across Pakistan. As is submitted in the Complaint, the Complainant is the sole distributor and right holder in Pakistan of a complete range of products sold under the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"", registered with The Trade Marks Registry in Karachi, Pakistan bearing trademark No. 179961 dated 28 August 2002 in class 5 for analgesic (pain relieving) pharmaceutical preparations. The products are sold in the form of spray, gel, and roll-on of different specifications bearing distinctive getup and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising predominantly of green and light blue coloured text and white background. Furthermore, it was submitted that the Complainant is enlisted with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) as the authorized importer and distributor of pharmaceutical products branded as ""BIOFREEZE"". The Complainant averred that the Respondent was fraudulently using similar, deceptive or confusingly similar mark ""BYQFREEZ"" in relation to similar pharmaceutical preparations in the form of spray and gel so as to pass off them as and for the products of the Complainant, which tantamount deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
4. The Enquiry Report examined whether the Respondent has contravened the provisions of section 10 of the Act. It was found that the Complainant is the authorized importer/distributor of ""BIO/FREEZE"" branded product line. Whereas the Respondent was engaged in the manufacture and sale of products branded as ""BYQFREEZ"" which were deceptively similar viz., phonetic similarity with the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" bearing highly similar label/design/colour to the unique, distinctive label/design/colour scheme with the Complainant's products. The Enquiry Report concluded that the Respondent's unauthorized and dishonest adoption of deceptively and/or confusingly similar trademark appears to be fraudulent use of trademark and labelling and packaging in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act. Furthermore, it was concluded that the Respondent appears to be disseminating false and misleading information, including its substantially lower pricing in the market to the detriment of consumers and competitors in contravention of clause (b) and clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act. ","In view of the submissions made by the parties in the subject proceedings, following issues merit deliberation:
i. Whether the Complainant's claim qua the trademark 'BIOFREEZE' and associated trade dress is valid for the purposes of section 10 of the Act?
ii. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clauses (d), (b) and (a) of subsection (2) read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act?
","the Complainant has made out its case that it is registered and authorized right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress in this case.
34. The Respondent, its proprietors, partners, directors, associates, agents, dealers, among others, are hereby restrained from using the impugned marks ""BYQFREEZ"" or any other mark with any prefix or suffix and trade dress that is phonetically, visually and constructively similar as that of the Complainant mark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress.
The Respondent has undertaken before the Bench that it will not repeat the contravention and comply with the provisions of section 10 of the Act. We, therefore, are inclined to take a lenient view and imposes penalty in the amount of PKR 2,500,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Hundred Thousand Only) pursuant to Section 38 of the Act on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is further directed to file, within sixty (60) days from the date of this order, a compliance report with reference to withdrawal of the products under the mark ""BYQFREEZ"" and stop using the said mark.
In case of non-compliance with the directions contained in Paras 34 and 35 ibid. of this order, the Respondent shall be further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to PKR 100,000 (Rupees one hundred thousand) per day from the date of this order.
38. In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.
","Before proceeding with the factual analysis, we would like to highlight and briefly explain the scope and objective of section 10 of the Act, which reads as follows:
'10. Deceptive marketing practices.---(1) No undertaking shall enter into deceptive marketing practices.
(2) The deceptive marketing practices shall be deemed to have been resorted to or continued of an Undertaking resorts to-
(a) the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking;
(b) the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods;
(c) [....]
(d) fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling and packaging.
Section 10 applies to all undertakings in Pakistan, regardless of their size and the way in which they are established or financed. The provisions of section 10 mandate the Commission to eliminate all causes of consumer deception or deceptive marketing practices. For deception to occur, there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumers. Second, the Commission examines the representation, omission or practice (collectively, ""practice"") from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. Reasonable is examined from the perspective of the ordinary consumer of the target group. Third, the representation, omission, or practice must be a ""material"" one. That is to say, whether the practice is likely to affect the consumer's conduct in terms of its purchasing decision viz., products or services. Advertising statements, disclosures, disclaimers or point of sale representations, inter alia, are the points where consumer first contacts between a seller and buyers. Whether or not a consumer buys a product is immaterial. The law may still be violated. Thus, a practice is material, there is the likelihood of consumer deception because it is presumed that the consumer might have chosen differently or made a different purchasing decision but for deception.
Keeping in view the alleged contravention, we are not concerned with the ""subjective intention"" but with the ""objective manifestation"" of intent to examine the concept of ""fraudulent use"". The prohibition, under clause (d) subsection (2) of section 10, applies to all forms of marks, including words, numbers, logos, pictures given that they function as source-identifier of a good or service.
Moreover, the application of the above clause does not differentiate between a registered and an unregistered mark. Nevertheless, with registration, a right holders' array of options for dealing with the unauthorized or fraudulent use of a trademark or trade dress is likely to increase. The registered trademarks, firm name or labelling and packaging are presumed to be valid and incontestable. Most importantly, they are used as apparatus to seek remedy against imitators claiming unawareness of the registration. By virtue of section 10, the legislature have, therefore, intended to protect consumers and trademark (and other commercial signs e.g., trade dress, symbols, colours or colour scheme, product shapes and product packaging and marketing themes, etc.) proprietors to be deprived of the property at the instance of business undertakings whose use is unauthorized and fraudulent.
It transpires from the record that M/s Performance Health, USA already had registered its trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" in 2002 in Pakistan and has successfully renewed it for a further period of ten years from 28 August 2009. Since its registration M/s. Performance Health have been commercially exploiting its trademark by way of export, distribution, marketing and sale of ""BIOFREEZE"" labelled products in Pakistan. At present, the Complainant is the sole licensor and authorized distributor of ""BIOFREEZE"" products of M/s Health Performance in Pakistan. Therefore, we are convinced that registration of the Trademark ""BIOFREEZ"" in favour of the Complainant is valid. Consequently, the Complainant, holds valid right to initiate action(s) against the imitators of its trademark and labelling and packaging under clause (d), subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.

In the Complaint as well as the Enquiry Report concluded that prima facie the Respondent has violated section 10 of the Act that is designated to protect consumers against unfair, deceptive, fraudulent trade and business practices and false advertising. In its previous decisions, the Commission has underscored certain key principles to assess the fraudulent use of another's trademark, misleading and deceptive labelling and packaging, and advertising, among other things. The following paragraphs briefly highlight the principles laid down under clause (d) subsection (2) section 10 of read with subsection (1) section 10 of the Act.
16. The Commission in one of its earlier Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of M/s. A. Rahim Food Pvt. Limited reported as 2016 CLD 1128, observed that ""parasitic copying"" (Look-alikes) of trademark and trade dress of a brand are inherent in all cases of ""fraudulent"" use of another's trademark, firm name, labelling, and packaging' and has laid down the following standards:
'a) It is now well-established principle under the majority of regulatory competition regimes around the world that mimicking the packaging design of familiar established brands is a misleading and deceptive ploy with the end purpose of boosting sales.
b) Such purpose or object of parasitic copycat packaging is driven [...] from [...] the perspective of the consumer. A potential purchaser is much more likely to mistake and perceive products which employ parasitic copying to be of better quality than they in fact are or as equivalent to the aggrieved competitor or market leader (whose packaging has been copied). Hence, a consumer is more likely to purchase such a product, rather than if the packaging was clearly distinctive and distinguishable.
c) The end result of such a practice is that the consumer is misled by the ""copycat"" who is fraudulently attempting to pass off its products as something else. Furthermore, the copycat incurs the minimal cost and in fact none of the cost of investment and innovation of a design that the market leader has spent to build goodwill and reputation of its brand assets in the relevant market. Hence, where product differentiation is insufficient, such a practice on the part of the copycat has fatal consequences for the business of the market leader.
d) In furtherance to the interpretation of the term ""fraudulent use [of another's trademark] "" of ""product labelling and packaging"" within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, it may be noted that fraud itself consists of some deceitful practice or wilful device to obtain an unjust advantage and which deprives another of right or causes another injury. The Commission, entrusted with the task of adjudicating upon a potential contravention under the Act, remains of the much wider context and purpose of the said prohibition. The Commission shall therefore, be satisfied that the evidence adduced before it is conclusive, if the strikingly similar packaging and labelling is misleading enough to cause confusion in the minds of average consumer of a commodity, with the end result of unjust advantage accruing to the copycat at the expense of and to the detriment of the complainant.
e) The Commission deems it appropriate to examine the packaging and product labelling appearance of a finished product as a whole which may collectively include visually confusing resemblance in elements of colour scheme, layout style, design, images, labels, font usage etc., instead of each individual similarity, in isolation, to come to its determination as to the contravention under section 10(2)(d) of the Act. It may also be noted that the Commission takes into account the surrounding circumstances which may be different in each particular case, as being peculiar to the parties, products, consumers and the relevant market.
f) Lastly, it may be noted that the worldwide consumer survey-based consensus is that when copycat packaging is developed for a particular commodity, price becomes the main and sometimes only criterion which affects a consumer's choice of purchase. Furthermore, when price becomes the sole determining factor for the exercise of choice between two products with no other meaningful distinguishing factor existing between such products, it is evidence of the presence of parasitic copying.
In the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. Shainal Al-Syed Foods dated 30th March 2018, referring to the judgment of Delhi High Court, reported as Colgate Palmolive Co. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care (Pvt.) Limited (2003) PTC 478 Del, wherein Colgate sought [...] to restrain Anchor Health's use of the trade dress and colour combination of red and white in relation to identical products i.e. tooth powder, even though the latter's trademark/tradename was completely different, the Court held that:
'52. It is overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, shape of the container, packaging etc.'
...
'If the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, get-up and layout appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one's own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter'.
Now keeping in view the parties' conduct and submissions before us, the facts scenarios in the instant case may be summarized as follows:
(i) The Complainant has claimed to be the registered proprietor of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and has stated to have adopted the trademark in respect of certain analgesic harmaceutical preparations and is distributing/selling in Pakistan since at least 2004. Furthermore, the Complainant has claimed to be the proprietor of the trade dress, which includes the containers and labels (comprising predominantly green and light blue colours with white background) of the products. The Complainant has submitted that on account of the efficacy and rigorous marketing the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"" and its unique trade dress have accumulated immense goodwill and international reputation including in Pakistan amongst the relevant members of trade as well as the public-at-large. Against this backdrop, the Complainant has alleged that by use of identical or deceptively similar trademark such as ""BYQFREEZ"" by the Respondent and appropriating or adopting prominently similar trade dress in terms of bottling, layout, get up and colour combination with obvious intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and deceive consumers, the Respondent has acted in contravention of section 10 of the Act.
(ii) The Respondent, on the other hand, has denied the allegations of passing off and deceptive marketing practices. In support of its case, the Respondent has contended that the two marks i.e. ""BIOFREEZE"" and ""BYQFREEZ HPRR"" are not identical. Furthermore, the Respondent has submitted that the ingredients of the Respondent's product are much different than the Complainants'. On 21.9.2017, the Complainant has deposed that between 2003 and 2014 it was the sole distributor of M/s. Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" product line in Pakistan. However, its distributorship was terminated in early 2014 because it failed to achieve its sales targets. Thereafter, the Respondent adopted ""Neucon Pakistan"" as its new business name. According to the Respondent, when it was intimated that the Complainant is the new authorized licensee/distributor of M/s Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" products in Pakistan, it launched its own brand ""BIOFREEZ HPQR"" for similar products i.e. analgesic pharmaceutical preparations. Currently, the Respondent has four distributors in Pakistan and its products are sold to the masses at pharmacies.
In view of the above, the we are of the considered opinion that the Complainant has proved beyond doubt that it is the registered proprietor and right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" as well as the trade dress i.e. green and light blue labelling and packaging of the products in question. Hence it has the exclusive right to use the trademark including trade dress of ""BIOFREEZE"". By adoption of an identical trademark i.e. ""BYQFREEZ"" and the trade dress - the overall getup, the Respondent has contravened clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
26. The Commission also finds that it is highly likely that the consumers would be deceived/misled by false and misleading depictions of the Respondent which constitutes a contravention of section 10(2)(b) read with section 10(1) of the Act. The Commission further finds that by resorting to the aforesaid practices the Respondent has failed to fulfil its obligation to avoid unfair competition and become unjustly rich by encashing on the goodwill or reputation of the Complainant, hence in violation of section 10(2)(a) read with section 10(1) of the Act.

COMPETITION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN and another---Respondents
","Appeals Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of 2018, decided on 12th September, 2018.",nil,"AHMED OWAIS PIRZADA, MEMBER TECHNICAL.","Ghulam Fareed (Proprietor Niaz Corporation), Grain Market, Bahawalpur, appellant in Appeal No.01/2018 and other appellants at Sr. Nos. 2 to 9 have filed Appeal No. 02/2018 to 09/2018, against the Judgment and order dated 29-12-2017, passed by learned Competition Commission of Pakistan.
The brief background of presentation of above appeals are that respondent No.2 Al-Rehman Oil Mills, lodged a complaint against appellants that they are using the registered Trade Mark 'TAIZGAAM' without any permission and legal justification, therefore, the appellants are guilty of deceptive marketing practices under section 10 of the Competition Act, 2010. The complaint of respondent No.2 was inquired into under section 37(2) of the Competition Act, 2010 and on the basis of inquiry report, show cause notices were issued to appellants. After obtaining the comments of Appellants, the learned Competition Commission of Pakistan heard the arguments of counsel for the parties and awarded penalty of Rs.300,000/- to each of the appellants under section 10(1) Competition Act through the impugned Judgment and order. Aggrieved from the same all the appellants have preferred these appeals. As a common question of law and facts are involved in all nine appeals, therefore, they are disposed off through present single Judgment.","""Whether the Complainant's claim qua the trademark 'TAIZGAAM' and associated trade dress is valid for the purposes of section 10 of the Act?""
""Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clauses (d), (b) and (a) of subsection (2) read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act?""","""From the above discussion, we have come to the conclusion that there is no evidence to the effect that the appellants have deliberately used the Trade mark 'TAIZGAAM' to harm the business interest of Respondent No.2. It is evident from the record that the appellants were using this Trade mark since long even prior to registration of this Trade mark in the year 2015 in favour of Respondent No.2. After getting knowledge of registered Trade mark, all the appellants have undertaken not to use the aforesaid Trade mark anymore.""
""The quantum of award of penalty depends upon wrong and illegal gains achieved by appellants - through use of aforesaid Trade mark with corresponding loss in business to respondent No.2. These disputed and controversial question of facts require recording of pro and contra evidence but neither any issue has been framed in this connection nor Respondent No.2 has supported the contents of his complaint through an affidavit or statement before the Commission. The complainant has neither recorded his statement on oath in support of his complaint in order to afford an opportunity to the appellants to cross-examine him in respect of the complaint. Similarly, no notice to admit documents or certified copies available on record has been issued by learned Competition Commission of Pakistan to the appellants. In absence of any oral or other reliable documentary evidence on record, the learned CCP was not justified to impose penalty on the appellants.""
""The appeal is, therefore, partly allowed and order of Competition Commission of Pakistan regarding penalty is set aside, while the remaining order of Competition Commission is maintained.""","The appellants at Sr. Nos. 1 to 6, have stated in their appeals that the word ""TAIZGAAM"" is originally created and used by the appellants before the registration of this Trade Mark by the respondent No.2. It has further been stated that this important and exclusive point of determination has not been considered by Competition Commission of Pakistan, while deciding the matter. It has been argued that like ""COLA"", the word ""TAIZGAAM"" could be used by the animal food manufacturers in addition to their distinctive names. It has been submitted that the word ""TAIZGAAM"" was always used with other distinctive names by the appellants for their independent recognition. It has been stated that the appellants were never associated while holding inquiry by the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It has further been stated that the colour scheme and the animal picture, which could be indentified and understood by a naked eye and the Trade mark of respondent No.II are fairly different from the one, used by the appellants. 
The appellants in their appeals at Sr. Nos. 7 and 8, in addition to the aforesaid grounds, have stated that their contentions through written reply, filed by them, were not made part of the court file by the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It has further been stated that the Commission has held the appellants guilty of violation of section 10(2)(a) of Competition Act, 2010 despite having found undeniable defence that the products being marketed by the appellants were carrying the name of appellant's contact numbers and other information relating to them. It has been pleaded that the Competition Commission of Pakistan failed to establish any single evidence, holding the appellants for guilty of use the Trade mark of Respondent No.II. It has been prayed that the impugned order, passed by Competition Commission of Pakistan may be set aside.The appellant mentioned at Sr. No. 9 in his appeal has stated, in addition to the aforesaid grounds, that the written commitment, filed by the appellant on the direction of the Competition Commission of Pakistan has completely been ignored by the Competition Commission while deciding the matter.
""During the proceedings before this Tribunal, all the appellants and respondent No.II are of the view that the Appellate Tribunal may give waiver of the penalty, imposed by Competition Commission of Pakistan on all the appellants, passing directions that violation of section 10(1) be checked strictly and in case violation is seen, the appellants shall be made liable to a penalty of Rs. 100,000/- (one hundred thousand) per day from the date of impugned order of the Competition Commission of Pakistan till actual compliance further initiating criminal proceedings under subsection (5) of section 38 of the Act. The learned counsel for the Commission has however, expressed his reservation in this behalf, requesting that the appeals may be dismissed and the impugned order passed by the Competition Commission of Pakistan may be endorsed completely.""
""We have gone through the appeals, filed by the appellants and heard the learned counsel for the appellants and respondents quite in detail. Section 10(1) of the Competition Act, 2010 provides that;
'no undertaking shall enter into deceptive marketing practices, which includes false or misleading comparison of goods in the process of advertising or fraudulent use of another's Trade Mark, firm name or product labelling or packaging'.""
""The preamble of this Act also provides free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti -competitive behavior. The spirit of the Competition Act clearly indicates that the objective of the law is to ensure fair business practices. During the proceedings before this Tribunal, the appellants have expressed their willingness to act in accordance with the directions of the Commission. The appellants have once again made a commitment before this Tribunal that they will not only abide by section 10(1) of the Competition Act, 2010 but also follow the directions of the Competition Commission of Pakistan mentioned in the order impugned before this Tribunal. We understand that the objective of the Competition Law in this particular case is achieved and the complainant who is respondent No.2 before us is completely comfortable if the appellants abide by the provisions of section 10(1) of the Competition Act, 2010 and in case of failure to comply with, they would be liable to a penalty of Rs. 100,000/- (one hundred thousand) per day from the date of impugned order till actual compliance and initiation of criminal proceedings under section 5 of section 38 of the Act before a court of competent jurisdiction. The appellants have also submitted that they are abiding by the aforesaid section of the Act and directions of the Commission. They have further admitted that in case, anyone of the appellants found guilty of not complying with the directions of the Commission and spirit of section 10(1) of the Competition Act, 2010, shall be liable to a penalty of Rs. 100,000/- (one hundred thousand) per day from the date of impugned order till actual compliance.""",HBT/14/CCOP Appeal partially allowed.,Allowed

Messrs HAROON SWEET FACTORY and another---Respondents

","R.F.A. No. 108 of 2006, decided on 16th October, 2017.","13th July, 2017.","MUHAMMAD FARRUKH IRFAN KHAN, J.","The brief facts out of which this appeal has arisen are that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants/respondents from infringement of its Trade Mark Hilal Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant has been manufacturing and marketing sweets and candies bearing the said trade mark along with its label/wrapper in a particular colour scheme and design since 1988. It was also asserted that due to good quality, the sweets and candies of the appellant under this specific trade mark and label/wrapper have acquired great reputation and goodwill throughout the country. It was claimed that the said trademark along with its colour scheme and design was pending registration in class 30 under application No.1471128 and the copyrights in the said packaging of Hilal Khopra Candy Sweets is duly protected under the Trade Mark and Copy Rights Laws. Along with the suit the appellant attached certificate, regarding pendency of trademark registration application in class 30. The appellant alleged that by adopting a trademark Haroon Khopra Candy Sweets with identical packaging/label/wrapper, the respondents are not only infringing the appellant's trademark rights but also passing off their goods as the goods of the appellant and are thus continuously deceiving the appellant's customers besides causing financial loss to it.
The respondents defended the suit by filing their written statement and raised a preliminary objection that the suit was filed by an incompetent person. On merit it was pleaded that the appellant has merely filed a copy of the application for registration of the trademark which does not confer any exclusive right or cause of action in favour of the appellant; that it was at the most a suit for passing off which was to be filed before the Court of competent jurisdiction i.e. Civil Court and that the Court of District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the instant suit and adjudicate upon it. They refuted the plea of the appellant that Haroon Khopra Candy or its wrapper/label are similar or identical to Hilal Khopra Candy and its wrapper/label and submitted that as no exclusive right is vested in the appellant it cannot seek restraint against use of a label/wrapper having different colour scheme and design by the respondents under their trademark Haroon Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant had no cause of action.","1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for permanent injunction, against the defendants as prayed for? OPP
2. Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action to file the suit? OPD
3. Whether the suit for plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed in view of preliminary objection No.2? OPD
4. Whether the defendant is entitled to recover special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C. from the plaintiff? OPD
5. Relief.
","I hold that the colour scheme, design and getup of label/wrapper of respondent/defendant Ex-P-22 is deceptively and confusingly similar or nearly resemble the colour scheme, design and getup of the label/wrapper of Appellant/Plaintiff Ex-P-16 and is likely to cause confusion and deception to an unwary purchaser. Issue No. 2 is therefore, answered in favour of Appellant/Plaintiff and against the respondent/defendant. 
In view of my findings on issue No.1, it is held that appellant plaintiff has got a locus standi and a valid cause of action to file the suit. The findings of the learned Trial Court on this issue are over turned and it is decided in favour of the appellant/plaintiff against the respondent defendant.
These issues have already been decided in favour of the appellants. The findings of the learned Trial Court on these two issues are affirmed.
In view of my above findings the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2005 is set aside and suit of the appellant/plaintiff is decreed as prayed for with no order as to cost.
","From bare perusal of the wrappers/labels of both the parties it is to be noted that appellant's product packing Ex.P-16 comprises of dark blue label in which the dark blue shade becomes lighter going right side. The word Hilal is written in yellow on the left upper corner WHILE the label/wrapper of the respondent also has a dark blue, light blue, white, green and red colour scheme design and get up with only a few points of difference here and there as compared to that of the appellant's label/wrapper described above. 
PW-1 on behalf of the appellant deposed that defendants are marketing/selling 'Haroon Khopra Candy' sweets in a wrapper which is almost similar to that of the plaintiff's and as such they are deceiving the ordinary customers. On the other hand the respondent's witness DW-1 has deposed that the plaintiff has filed a false case against the defendant. He further stated that plaintiff's product is being sold by the name and style of 'Hilal Khopra Candy' whereas the name of defendant's product is 'Haroon Khopra Candy'; that the trademark of defendant's company is in the name of 'Haroon' while the name of plaintiff's trademark is 'Hilal'; that the defendant company is not copying the plaintiff's trademark. it can be concluded that these trademarks are identical. Moreover, it has come in the evidence of the defendant that Khopra is being sold by 30/35 companies in blue colour, as such it is concluded that even if plaintiff is prior user, even then it would not give right to the plaintiff to claim exclusive right in respect of' words Khopra Candy, hence it is concluded that the plaintiff was unable to prove issue.
The above findings of the learned Trial Court proceed on wrong premises. The Registration Certificate dated 20th November, 2014 of the plaintiff Ex.P-26 has not been taken into consideration in its true perspective. Only the disclaimer appearing on the Registration Certificate that appellant/plaintiff has no exclusive right in respect of Khopra Candy has been relied. Thus the Trial Court has erred in mixing the disclaimer on the word Khopra Candy with the rights that the appellant/plaintiff has claimed by virtue of the Registration of the features of the whole label i.e. colour scheme, design, get-up etc. In addition to this, the learned Trial Court has committed a further error by overlooking the established principle of law that for maintaining a passing off action registration of a trademark is not a requirement and even though there may be a disclaimer on any particular feature on a wrapper/label.
It has to be noted that under the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 a Mark has been defined by section 2(xxiv) as follows:-
""Mark includes, in particular a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name including personal name, signature, word, letter, numeral, figurative element, colour, sound or any combination thereof.""
Thus the law envisages each one of the above features namely, inter alia, a name, a word, figurative element, colour, etc., to be a mark by itself and goes on to further specify that any combination of these features would be a mark also. In the market place, generally for consumer products, it is usual for companies to market their products in attractive colourful labels/wrappers/packaging, which often carries a word, a figurative element, a particular colour scheme, design and get up. Each one of these features, as the definition of the 'Mark"" envisages, is a mark in itself. When one feature of a label consisting of a combination of marks is adopted or copied, infringement or copying of that feature (a mark) takes place which is liable to be remedied and it will not be a valid defence by a defendant that he has not adopted/imitated other features of the label mark, which may be different. Thus when a label comprising of a colour scheme, design and get up is copied/imitated by adopting a similar colour scheme, design and get up but with a different word, infringement to the extent of colour scheme design, and get up would take place and can be injuncted to that extent. Similarly if a word is copied but not the colour scheme, design and get up, the infringement takes place only to the extent of word mark and it will not be open to a defendant to allege that due to different word mark, or different colour scheme, design, get up, in the respective labels/packaging, there will be no likelihood of confusion or deception. This aspect has been explained/expounded in a number of reported cases, in a different context, by holding that when one or more of the essential features of a mark or a label is infringed, infringement takes place, for example, in the cases of ""Cecil De Cordova and others v. Vick Chemical Company"" (PLD 1951 Privy Council 108), Jamia Industries Ltd v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8), ""Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others"" (2001 SCMR 967) I would, therefore, hold that the plea that respondent's/defendant's mark is ""HAROON KHOPRA CANDY"" whereas Appellant's/Plaintiff's mark is ""HILAL KHOPRA CANDY"" and that the former's label/wrapper, colour scheme, design and get up, (Ex.P-22) which otherwise is confusing and nearly resembling to that of latter's label/wrapper colour Scheme, design and get-up (Ex.P-16) be considered to be different is not a legally sustainable defence and must be rejected.
Comparison by court between two marks not to be meticulous - Court to reach mind of an unwary purchaser - Question in cases of alleged conflict between two marks always being whether a person will be deceived when he sees one trade mark in absence of another mark.

ROYAL PVC (PVT.) LTD. through Chief Executive---Respondent

","F.A.Os. Nos. 326 and 327 of 2012, decided on 12th February, 2018.","26th January, 2018.","SHAHID KARIM, J.","This appeal lays a challenge to the order dated 08.05.2012 passed by the Registrar of Trademarks, Lahore. The impugned order decided two cross rectification applications. Rectification No.15 of 2010 was filed against the registration No.158845 in class 17 registered in the name of Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd., Peshawar. Rectification Application No.26 of 2011 was filed against the registration No.84678 in class 17, registered in the name of Royal Enterprises, Lahore. For the sake of brevity, Rectification No.15 of 2010 filed by Royal Enterprises, Lahore shall be referred as the ""Rectification 15"" and the Rectification No.26 of 2011 shall be referred as ""Rectification 26"".
2. This judgment shall decide two appeals, the instant appeal FAO No.326 of 2012 and F.A.O. No. 327 of 2012 filed by Muhammad Ismail (Appellant) against the order of the Registrar Trademarks dated 08.05.2012 by which order the trademark (Royal) registration bearing No.84678 in class 17 was expunged from the trademark register and the trademark (Royal) of Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. bearing No.158845 in class 17 was retained on the register of trademark.
3. The appellant filed application, Rectification 15 against the trademark 'Royal' on the ground inter alia that:
a. That the application for trademark 'Royal' was filed on 03.12.1984 and was assigned to the present proprietor on 03.10.2005;
b. That the said trademark was being used since that time by the appellant;
c. That the registration of trademark Royal hearing No.158845 was secured by the respondent through fraud and with the sole object of making wrong gain out of the goodwill and reputation of the appellant's trademark registered earlier in time relating to the same goods; and
d. That the registration of the impugned trademark was obtained without sufficient cause and was liable to be rectified from the register of trademarks.
4. The respondent had, on an earlier occasion, filed an application for rectification of the register under section 73(a) and (b) of the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001 before the Sindh High Court at Karachi for the removal of the appellant's trademark. It was held by the Sindh High Court that the proper forum for such an application was the Registrar of Trademarks and could not be filed directly before the High Court. The respondent was permitted to file an application for revocation of registration of the appellant's trademark before the Registrar Trademarks and consequently the respondent flied Rectification 26 in respect of trademark of appellant on the ground of non user of mark.
","On the basis of pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed by the Registrar of Trademarks:-
a. Whether the applicant namely Royal Enterprises, Lahore was a person aggrieved in the circumstances of the case?
b. Whether the Registration of Trademark under No.1 58845 in class 17 for ""Royal"" was obtained by the Respondent namely Royal PVC (Pvt.) Limited, Peshawar in bad faith and by fraud.
c. Whether the mark registered under No.84678 in Class 17 in the name of Royal Enterprises, Lahore is liable to be removed from the Register due to non-user of the mark.
","In view of the above, the impugned decision of the Registrar Trademark is unexceptional and is hereby upheld. The appeals filed by the appellant are consequently dismissed.","The primary contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant was that the Registrar Trademarks travelled beyond the pleadings of the parties and rendered a decision on the basis of clause 'b' of subsection (1) of section 73. Precisely, the case of the appellant is that the respondent had challenged the trademark registration of the appellant on the touchstone of clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 73 and clause 'b' was not at all the basis for the challenge while the Registrar Trademarks had rendered its decision on the basis of clause 'b' and not clause 'a'. which has impinged upon the right of the appellant to be treated fairly and with due process of law. According to the learned counsel, since the challenge on the basis of clause 'b' was not in the contemplation of the appellant, he was precluded from adducing the relevant evidence relating to allegations of non-user for the last five years prior to the making of the rectification application. However, the issue at 'c' reproduced above, relates to the question as to whether the mark registered in the name of the appellant was liable to be removed from the register due to non user of the mark. The said issue fails to identify whether it relates to clause 'a' or clause 'b' and contrary to the claim of the appellant the issue is couched in unreal terms and places the onus on the appellant to prove not only the allegation with regard to clause 'a' but also with regard to clause 'b'. It may be stated that the first five years envisaged by clause 'a' would commence from 03.12.1984 and would extend to 03.12.1989 whereas the period covered by clause 'b' will commence from March, 2006 and end in March, 2011, till the filing of the application by the respondent. However, paragraph 26 of the rectification application filed by the respondent puts paid to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant which forms the main plank of the attack of the appellant to the impugned decision rendered by the Registrar Trademarks. It has specifically been mentioned in paragraph 26 that the challenge as both on the basis of clause 'a' and clause 'b' of subsection (1) of section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 and not merely on the basis of clause 'a' alone. Therefore, the appellant was obliged to adduce the relevant material and evidence which would bring home the fact that the appellant was not guilty of lack of use of the trademark for both the periods contemplated by clause 'a' and clause 'b'.
It can be seen from the list of documents reproduced above, that these documents do not establish neither the requirement of clause 'a' nor of clause 'b' and it does not matter whether additional evidence is allowed to be produced or not. To reiterate, none of the above documents are proof of user between 1984 and 1989 (the first five years). This is on account of the fact that whether it be a case under clause 'a' or 'b' the appellant has not brought home the onus placed by issue 'c' and has failed to discharge that onus. Both the applications C.M. 1 of 2013 and C.M. 1 of 2014 are, therefore, dismissed.
Learned counsel for the respondent rightly pointed out that the only raw material for the manufacture of the goods by both the appellant as well as the respondent is PVC Raisin and for which a company by the name of Engro Polymer is the only suppliers and, therefore, the most pertinent and relevant evidence was the invoices etc. in respect of the supplies from Engro Polymer. The appellant has not attached any document which would show the supplies to have been made by Engro Polymer to the appellant for the manufacture of UPVC Pipe. The documents produced by the appellant with the Registrar Trademarks and now sought to be produced as additional evidence do not show the use of material which conforms to the Pakistan Standards. Also the electricity and gas bills have not been produced in order to show that the manufacturing facility of the appellant is in operation. Contrarily, the respondent has produced documents before the Registrar which show clearly that the respondent has been in use of the trademark ""Royal"". Documents were produced to the effect that the respondent was registered with the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority in respect of UPVC pressure pipes for cold potable water of royal brand. The certificate shows that the respondent is making annual marking fee of 0.05% of the annual production value for the continued validity of the certificate. Similarly the respondent is an approved contractor for the supply of UPVC pipes in respect of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Jammu and Kashmir health departments. Apart from this, the respondent produced a license from Pakistan Engineering Council dated 23.12.2006 which mentions its field of specialization of UPVC pipes which further lends support to the contention of the respondent that it is a bona fide manufacturer of UPVC pipes and use of trademark ""Royal"". The most crucial documents submitted by the respondent before the Registrar of Trademarks were sales tax invoices, sale tax returns and export documents for the period between 2006 to 2011 which clearly mention the word ""Royal"" as trademark as well as value of the products and the sales tax paid on it. Export invoices have also been attached by the respondent which are required to be furnished by the exporter pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and attested by the State Bank of Pakistan.",MWA/M-35/L Appeals dismissed.,Dismissed

SHEZAN SERVICES LIMITED (Now known as SHEZAN SERVICES (PRIVATE) LIMITED---Appellant
Versus
SHEZAN BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003, decided on 19th May, 2018.","25th April and 4th May, 2018.","Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, J","This Misc. Appeal under section 76 of Trademarks Act, 1940 impugns an order of the Registrar of Trademarks passed in dealing with Opposition No.218/2001 while considering the application of the respondent, registered as No.100857/29. The order on the opposition releases the application from such opposition and proceeded it for registration subject to the conditions that the word ""Shezan"" shall always be used in collaboration with either Lahore Continental, Lahore Oriental or Lahore Bakery and will always be used within the territory of Lahore Division.
2. It is the time of the appellant that they entered into the agreement with one Shezan Lahore, which was a partnership firm at the relevant time having its partners as Ch. Riazuddin and Rao Muhammad Usman, which then, with the passage of time, has taken shape of Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited, respondent No. 1 herein. Thus, Shezan Lahore in fact is a predecessor in right of the respondent Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited.
3. It is the case of the appellant that the agreement dated 19.02.1975 with their predecessor and the predecessor of respondent No.1 was in respect of two restaurants i.e. Shezan Continental at 46-Dingah Singh Building, and Shezan Oriental, 7-Dayal Singh Mansions, both at Shahrah-e-Qaid-e-Azam Lahore and a bakery to serve the above two restaurants for sale of their product. Appellant have attempted to argue that in terms of aforesaid agreement they have agreed to sell and the respondent No.1 has agreed to buy the goodwill of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery, which does not include the sale of word ""Shezan"" as trademark, either with or without logo.
","Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent cannot take shelter of subsection (2) of section 10 of 'Trademarks Act, 1940 as they were not concurrent user of the trademark in its actual perspective. Learned counsel for the appellant further relied upon Chapter 5 i.e. assignment and transmission of the Trademarks Act, 940 and relied upon section 29, which deals with the assignment and transmission of trademark, whether in connection with the goodwill of the business or not, and went on to argue that these two are different and distinct entities, as understood from the language of section 29, and since word 'Shezan' as trademark was never specifically assigned or transmitted, it could only be presumed that goodwill of the business of two restaurants and bakery, including the rights of trademark, was assigned under the aforesaid agreement. He has further relied upon the judgment of Additional CIT v. Kwality Frozen Foods from Indian jurisdiction of Mumbai Bench in IT Appeal No.5023 (Mum.) of 2001, which is an unreported matter, Noor Muhammad v. Civil Aviation Authority reported in 1987 CLC 393, Seven Up Company v. Deputy Registrar Trademark reported in 1937 MLD 91.
On the other hand learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has relied upon provisions of section 10(2) of Trademarks Act, 1940 and submitted that it is the honest concurrent use since 1975 that enabled the respondent No.1 to file application, referred above; before the Registrar Trademarks which was subjected to the opposition of the appellant and was disposed of in terms of the impugned order. She has attempted to argue that before 1975 the predecessor of the appellant and respondent were partners but without making an attempt to establish such relationship she relied upon the terms of the agreement dated 19.02.1975, which, per learned counsel, is sufficient to claim their concurrent use and entitlement for its registration under the law. In support of her contention, she has relied upon the case of Cluett, Peobody & Co. v. Assistant Registrar Trademark 1991 SCMR 921 which defines the concurrent use of trademark and the case of Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090. She further relied upon the judgment in the case of Levi and Volika of the Chancellery Division 1879 and the case of Crembux Limited of Chancellery Division 1928.
",Upshot of the above discussion is that the appellant has failed to make out a case calling to interfere in the impugned order as passed by the Registrar of Trademark hence the appeal is dismissed.,"The impugned decision concludes in paragraphs 14 and 15 that the respondent is using the trademark Shezan as a result of agreement of 1975 and there appears to be no moral, ethical and legal justification for the opposition of the appellant. It was further observed that the opponent/appellant had himself given the right to use the mark ""for consideration"" and the opposition to register the said mark is not tenable on account of continuous use since 1975 without any action on their part hence respondent No.1 stood qualified for the registration under section 10(2). The Registrar however restricted its use while dismissing the opposition and releasing the application of the respondent for its process of registration to two restaurants i.e. Continental and Oriental and Bakery, all of them situated within the territory of Lahore division.
In order to conclude as to whether along with goodwill the trademark ""Shezan"" was also passed on to respondent, the perusal of the terms of the agreement would be very material. In the first recital of the agreement, the company i.e. appellant stated to be carrying on business of hotel, restaurant and bakery in various towns of Pakistan including Lahore and then these three subject premises were described. In the second recital these three premises were claimed to be on rental and the respondent No.1 was given the obligation to deal with the issue of renewal of such leases. In the fifth recital of second page of the agreement, it is stated that on account of negotiations, the company i.e. appellant's predecessor has agreed to sell and the firm i.e respondent's predecessor has agreed to buy the ""goodwill"" of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery at a price which was acknowledged by the appellant/their predecessor. In term of first recital of the third page it is stated that through a separate negotiation the firm/respondent had purchased from the company/appellant against consideration the machinery and air-conditioning etc.
The covenants of the agreement also provide right to continue the business of these two restaurants and bakery and at such other places where the firm/respondent may deem fit within the territorial limits of Lahore division only under the subject name and style i.e. Shezan. However, it restricts its use in any other manner whatsoever except provided above.
The word ""goodwill"" and ""trademark"" were attempted to be treated as blood relatives. I would go on to penetrate further that in the subject case goodwill of a premises or of a place or of a business would worth nothing in case the subject and the essence of that business is extracted. If for instance a restaurant is being run successfully, it is not only premises or the infrastructure or ambiance that carries the reputation; it is the name and brand that carries the reputation too which is non-extractable part of goodwill and that may contribute towards building of a reputation. If one excludes the name of any good restaurant then it will be left with no other asset except an immovable property. The interpretation of subsection (2) of section 10 of Trademarks Act, 1940, in view of the above, cannot he restricted to a simple concurrent use irrespective of any agreement. Use of trademark under the agreement is not only permissive use but conclusive rights were being delegated and hence the use is concurrent to the use of the inventor. The subject use thus would come within honest concurrent use under the circumstances described in the agreement. It is inconceivable that the appellant would enjoy the consideration of a rental premises if the right of trademark is excluded. Certainly the consideration was for a particular territory i.e. Lahore division which was taken care of by the Registrar.
20. Had it been a case of permissive use only the appellant would have claimed a royalty for continuous use of the word/trademark, which is not the case here. It only advances the case of the respondent that the sale of goodwill includes the sale of trademark subject to its use within the territory defined therein.

AMAN ELLAHI---Appellant
Versus
The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 64 of 2017, decided on 12th January, 2018.","27th November, 2017","MRS. ASHRAF JAHAN, J.","The facts leading to the present appeal as per case of the Appellant are that they are proprietor of ""Moonlite Trading Company"", (hereinafter referred to as (""the Appellant Company""), which is a merchant, importer and marketer of self-designed consumer goods and other items. Since last several decades the Appellant Company is carrying the business of merchant and import of consumer goods including lotions, toiletries, perfumes, deodorants, air-fresheners, diapers and insecticides in Pakistan. The products imported by the Appellant Company are being marketed and sold under various Trade Marks, which include Cobra, Lotion Cobra, Soft Touch, Ku Ku, Lotion Saffire, Mascot, etc. They have also developed distinctive designs, logos or artwork for use in connection with the aforesaid brands including Appellant's current and long standing Trade Mark ""COBRA"". Therefore, in its pursuance, the Appellant Company obtained registration of the Trade Mark ""COBRA"" under Registration No.99323 in international class 05 since 11.08.1988 under the Ordinance, 2001, which registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes till today. In order to further strengthen its proprietorship, the Appellant either directly or through their company has also secured copyright registration under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962. The Appellant's product bearing ""COBRA"" has been and continued to be sold and promoted extensively throughout Pakistan since year 1988 without any hindrance from any quarter and thus they had invested substantial amount in the promotion and publicity of the product bearing ""COBRA"" mark and therefore, the Appellant company enjoys an enviable reputation and goodwill in the said Trade Mark in Pakistan.
It is further the case of the Appellant that on or about 31.03.2010, Respondent No.2 applied for the Registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", which was accepted for publication in the Trade Mark Journal in order to invite Opposition and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 733 in the month of February, 2012. Immediately upon becoming aware of such publication, the Appellant filed a Notice of Opposition bearing Opposition No.455/2013 against the grant of Registration of Mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" on the ground, inter alia, that the Trade Mark applied for is identical to the Appellant's trade mark ""COBRA"" and is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the consumers. In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Opposition, Respondent No.2 filed its counter statement contending that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was adopted in 2009 in order to distinguish its goods from other competitors and Notice of Opposition is liable to be dismissed on the ground that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is quite distinguishable from the Appellant's mark ""COBRA"", thus, qualifies for registration.
Subsequently, in January, 2014 it came to the Appellant's knowledge that Respondent No.2 in connivance with others had commenced their illegal activities of importing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and selling their goods in Karachi under the name and style of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", therefore, immediately upon becoming aware of such illegal activities, the Appellant filed Suit No.192/2014 against Respondent No.2 for infringement of rights, passing off, unfair competition, declaration and permanent injunction. In these proceedings vide order dated 03.02.2014 interim injunction was also passed, restraining Respondent No.2 from using mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". During the pendency of above suit and proceedings in Opposition No.455/2013, Appellant came to know that Respondent No.2 in the present appeal illegally obtained Trade Mark Registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", thereafter a detailed order was passed on 06.06.2014 in Suit No.192/2014, whereby the Appellant was required to file an application for invalidation of registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". Meanwhile, Respondent No.2 filed H.C.A. No.220/2014 against the order dated 06.06.2014 passed by the Single Bench in Suit No.192/2014 and the said order of Single Judge was suspended by the Division Bench vide its order dated 25.09.2014. The appeal was dismissed and the matter was remanded to the learned Single Judge to decide the injunction application in Suit No.192/2014. On 13.03.2017, an order was passed, whereby the registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was held as null and void and Respondent No.1 was directed to proceed with Opposition No.455/2013 and to pass a speaking order within thirty days. As a result thereof, the cancellation of the illegal registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing application No.280917 in class 5 was confirmed in Trade Marks Journal No.794 dated 01.03.2017. Opposition No.455/2013 came up for final hearing on 04.05.2017 before Respondent No.1 and subsequently on 10.08.2017 short order dated 07.08.2017 was communicated to the Appellant, disallowing the Opposition of the Appellant and allowing the application bearing No.280917 in class 5 of Respondent No.2 to proceed with registration with the disclaimer of word ""Cobra"" and all descriptive words/letters/device appearing on the label.
As the above order was received to the Appellant on 10.08.2017, they applied for certified copy of the decision, but the same was not communicated, hence they filed appeal only on the basis of short order communicated to them. However, subsequently, in compliance of Court's order dated 20.11.2017 detailed order was supplied to the parties, which is impugned by way of present appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed Counter Affidavit to this appeal and denied all the allegations/averments/statements made in the memorandum of titled appeal and supported the impugned order.
","It is contended by learned counsel for the Appellant that the impugned order has been passed, ignoring the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the provisions of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; in particular section 17 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been wrongly applied by Respondent No.1 while passing the order. Per learned counsel, the product bearing mark ""COBRA"" continued to be in use in Pakistan by the present Appellant since 1987 and the Appellant is the proprietor of the mark ""COBRA"" bearing Registration Nos.99323 and 106208 in classes 5 and 16 respectively; the earliest registration was obtained in the year 1988. The Respondent No.1 for arriving at the decision in respect of Opposition No.455/2013 has ignored and misconstrued the orders dated 13.02.2017, 20.02.2017 and 13.03.2017 passed by this Court in J.M. No.34/2014, wherein learned Judge clearly observed in the order that the trade mark registration was nearly identical, therefore, was in violation of the trade mark laws. This being the position, impugned decision passed by Respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
On the other hand, it is contended by learned counsel for Respondent No.2 that Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of import and for its products of insecticides had used trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", since year 2009. Per learned counsel, the Respondent's products under the Ordinance, 2001 referred to above are sold in Pakistan since 2009 onwards and expenditure of millions of rupees is incurred upon the advertisement of such products and it was well in knowledge of the Appellant since 2009, but they remained silent; neither objected nor otherwise filed any suit to restrain Respondent No.2 from using trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" and it is only in the month of February, 2014 after a delay of almost five years, they filed Suit No.192/2014 and obtained ex parte ad-interim injunction order in the suit, whereby Respondent No.2 was restrained from using its proprietor trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"".",For the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of Respondent No.1 is set aside and the Opposition No.455/2013 filed by the appellant is allowed. The application of Respondent No.2 bearing No.280917 is rejected.,"It is contended by learned counsel that the word ""COBRA"" per se is descriptive, suggestive and common to trade in relation to insecticides and herbicides; therefore, provisions of section 17 subject to provision of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001 are not applicable to the present case. They have got only registered their label and have not obtained any registration for the word ""COBRA"". Presently a larger number of competitors of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 are selling their insect killing products in various parts of the world including Pakistan using descriptive, suggestive and common to trade word ""COBRA"" and no confusion and deception has been caused to any person, therefore, in the light of above factual and legal position, Respondent No.1 has rightly passed the order, which has been impugned before this Court with wrong perception and ulterior motives. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following case law:
2013 CLD 330 (Tillotts Pharma AG v. GETZ Pharma (Private) Limited.)
1989 SCMR 361 (Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd.)
2007 CLD 991 (Messrs Master Textile Mills Ltd. v. Master Fabrics)
2007 CLD 997 (Abid Aziz Khan and 2 others v. Bank of Punjab).
Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 submitted that the order passed by Respondent No.1 has been passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the impugned order is valid and needs no interference at this stage.
Reasoning and Analysis
I have considered the arguments advanced before me by both the sides and have perused the case record.
To commence with, the material placed on record shows that so far as the claim of the Appellant as regards registration of trade mark ""COBRA"" and its prior use, disclosed in paragraphs two to five of the memo of appeal is concerned, it is an undeniable reality established on record; therefore, it needs no further discussion. Moreover, from the contents of earlier order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34/2014 it is also established that earlier certificate for registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing No.138268 dated 24.02.2014 in relation to trade mark No.280917 was issued by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 in blatant violation of the scheme of trade mark laws and thus declared null and void, which position was conceded before the Court by Respondent No.1 and not much disputed by Respondent No.2. In this background now it is to be seen that how far the subsequent impugned order dated 07.08.2017 passed by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 once again affirming the earlier stance (reasons recorded on 20.09.2017) is legal and within the frame work of the Ordinance, 2001. In this context firstly it is to be noted that purported prior use of trade mark ""COBRA"" by Respondent No.2 on the strength of earlier order of Respondent No.1, which was set aside by this Court vide order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34 of 2014 was nullity and void thus such period could not be considered by the Respondent No.1 as valid ground to justify the subsequent impugned order; observations of Respondent No.1 for this purpose are therefore ill-founded and perverse. Based on these facts there is no difficulty for me to hold that on one side the claim of Appellant regarding registration and use of trade mark ""COBRA"" is fully established and on the other side the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in the same category of goods is on weak footings, unless the Respondent No.2 could satisfy that use of prefix 'faster black' in their label before ""COBRA"" is sufficient to dislodge the opposition No.455 of 2013 filed by the Appellant. I have called for the samples of both the respective products from the learned counsel for the appellant and Respondent No.2 and by placing them in juxtaposition carefully examined the same, with reference to labels of ""COBRA"" and ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", and also the package material, size, shape, colour scheme and overall printed text. For ready reference their picture is placed below, which depicts similarities in the two products, sufficient to cause confusion among the ordinary customers.
The main guiding principle to examine the genuineness of the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for the registration of its trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is that upon comparison of the two, the Court is to be satisfied that there are sufficient features to differentiate between the two trade marks phonetically as well as visually, so that an unwary buyer of the same product, as in the instant matter, is genuinely not confused and misguided due to the feature of similarities between the two. In my considered opinion, the concept of totality of impression, test of average consumer etc. recorded by the Respondent No.1 in its order dated 20.09.2017 is misconceived and erroneous. As observed by me there are sound reasons disclosed by the Appellant in his Opposition No.455/2013, which justify grant of such opposition and consequent rejection of Application of 280917 in class 5 of registration of Trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in favour of Respondent No.2. This view of the matter is supported from the following judgments of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which are of binding nature:
PLD 1984 Supreme Court 8 (Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another).
PLD 1990 Supreme Court 313 (Seven-Up Company v. Kohinoor Thread Ball Factory and 3 others).
2012 SCMR 1504 (Shan Food Industries v. Eastern Products (Pvt.) Ltd. and others).

","Suit No. 2223 of 2015 and Judicial Miscellaneous No. 9 of 2016, decided on 13th June, 2017.",,,"This single order will dispose of C.M.A. No.16652/2015 moved by the Plaintiff in Suit No.2223 of 2015, seeking injunction against the Defendant from using the getup and design of Design No.17023-D owned by the Plaintiff, as well as, restraining the Defendant from using trade mark ""ZORRO"" on the ground that the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of trade mark ""ORO"", as well J.M.No.09/2016 filed by the Defendant will also be disposed off, through which cancellation of the Plaintiff's registered design has been sought by the Defendant.
While it is admitted that the Plaintiff owns trade mark ""ORO"" which has been registered by it with the Trade Marks Registry in respect of class 16 goods w.e.f. 22.09.2010, it also has secured registration of the design of pencils (under dispute) as provided under the mechanism laid down by the Registered Designs Ordinance, 2000. An examination of the Design Registration Certificate dated 23.01.2014 shows that the novelty of the design has been claimed to reside in the ornamental pattern as applied to pencils, as fully illustrated in the representation of the design. 
Allegation levelled by the counsel for the Plaintiff are that the Defendant taking benefit of the attractive design of the Plaintiff commenced manufacturing of similarly designed pencils and to leave no stone unturned to reap benefit from the hard earned reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff, even applied thereon trade mark ""ZORRO"", which is allegedly deceptively similar with the Plaintiff's trade mark ""ORO"".","When attention is drawn to J.M. No.09/2016 in terms of which cancellation of Plaintiff's registered design is sought, the grounds alleged for such a cancellation are that the design registered by the Plaintiff is not new, easily available in the local and international market thus there is no element of novelty therein which is mandatory for obtaining registration of a design. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the Defendant produced a large number of pencils manufactured by third parties, which seemingly look alike the design registered by the Plaintiff. It was contended by the counsel that the said design was introduced in 1990 by M/s. Staedtler Mars GmbH & Co. a German company for its ""Noris"" range of pencils, which have been globally sold since then. In support of his contentions, he attached copies of Noris pencils.","The residual effect of the above is that while the Plaintiff has lost his design Registered No.17023-D on account of forceful attack made by the Defendant through J.M.No.09/2016, the Defendant is still restrained from using deceptively similar ""ZORRO"" trademarked pencils embodying the typical colours scheme (trade dress) adopted by the Plaintiff.

 
","As mentioned in the foregoing, to have a design registered under the Ordinance and to have a monopoly created thereon, it is essential that the design must have element of newness or originality under section 3(2) of the Ordinance and in the absence of the said newness or originality, no design could be registered. The condition of newness and originality, which under the previous 1911 Patent and Design Act was only limited to Pakistan, was extended globally under the 2000 Ordinance meaning thereby to have a design registered under the 2000 Ordinance, the design must be globally new or original.
The term ""design"" is defined by clause (e) of section 2 of the Ordinance to mean (in the given context) features of shape, configuration, pattern ornament applied to an article by any industrial process or means, being features which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye. Subsection (2) of section 3 requires that a design not to be registered unless it was new or original and, in particular, shall not be so registered in respect of any article if it is the same as a design which before the date of the application for registration has been registered in Pakistan or published anywhere in the world in respect of the same or any other article or differs from such a design only in immaterial details or in features which are variants commonly used in the trade. Explanation to the said section provides that designs would not be new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combination of design features. It is important to keep in mind that section 3 is couched in the negative terms, and requires that the design which is not new or original cannot be registered. The expression, ""new or original"" appearing in section 3 means that the design had been invented for the first time or it has not been reproduced by anyone before. As mentioned in the foregoing, since a design is to be judged solely by the eye, the said definition read with application for registration makes it clear that the shape or particular configuration has to have visual newness or originality. Such design, once it is registered cannot be copied by any other person, as long as the design is new or original and never ever reproduced by any other person. In the case at hand a large number of triangular shaped pencils, which were produced before this Court were allegedly available in the market and such shape of triangular shaped pencils being in common knowledge for decades, hence by no stretch of imagination such pencils which have been registered by the Plaintiff could be said to be new or original and invented by the Plaintiff. A simple search in Google for the phrase ""triangular shaped pencils"" shows about over 1.7 million hits. The fact is that these triangular shaped pencils have been in use since long for teaching toddlers how to write effectively as the circular pencils are hard to be held by small hands, being easy in grip, the said design has thus been popular and widely sold for decades. In Phillips v. Barbro Rubber Company (1920) 37 R.P.C. 233, Lord Moulton emphasized that it is the duty of the court to take special care that no design is to be counted as new and original design unless it distinguished from that previously existed by something essentially new or original which is different from ordinary trade variants. The very intent of section 10 of the Ordinance is to remove registrations of such designs from the Register which were registered in violation of substantive requirements prescribed by the Ordinance. In the case at hand it is abundantly clear that the design registered by the Plaintiff is devoid of newness or originality and it could also not be said that the Plaintiff had induced creative ingenuity in this very commonly available design to the extent that the resulting design could withhold the threshold of newness or originality and stay registered as such. Accordingly, the J.M.No.09/2016 is allowed on the ground of lack of newness and originality in the Plaintiff's designed pencils.
Notwithstanding the above conclusion, a comparison of the rival pencils as shown above reveals that the Defendant has not only used identical colour scheme and getup (trade dress) of pencils used by the Plaintiff, as well as, its trade mark ""ZORRO"" embodies Plaintiff's complete trade mark ""ORO"" in full, therefore, when Moron in a Hurry test as developed by Mr. Justice Foster in the 1978 Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited [1979 FSR 113] is applied, there is no doubt that an unwary purchaser will not be deceived on account of the startling resemblances between the rival pencils. Accordingly the application filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. by the Plaintiff succeeds.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICES ISSUED TO MESSRS OPTIONS INTERNATIONAL (SMC-PVT.) LIMITED ON COMPLAINT FILED BY MESSRS STARBUCKS CORPORATION, USA

"," In the matter of F. No. 282/STARBUCKS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 17th August, 2018.",,,"This order shall dispose of the application dated 01st August 2018 (the 'IO Application') filed by M/s. Starbucks Corporation of the United States of America (the 'Complainant') for interim relief filed under section 32 of the Competition Act 2010 (the 'Act') read with Regulation 25(3) of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulation 2007 (the 'GER').
In the instant matter, the Commission vide the Show Cause Notice (the 'SCN') dated 04th May 2018 issued to M/s. Options International (SMC-Pvt.) Limited (the 'Respondent') notified that there exists a prima facie case of contravention of sections 10(2)(d) and 10(2)(b) read with section 10(1) of the Act and called upon to show cause in writing within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt of the SCN and also to appear and place before the Commission the facts and material in support of its contentions either in person or through an authorized representative on 17th May 2018 at the office of the Commission and to explain why an appropriate order under section 31(1)(c) of the Act may not be passed and/or a penalty for the aforesaid violation may not be imposed under section 38 of the Act.
On 07th May 2018, a letter was received from the Complainant's counsel stating that they are unable to attend the Commission on 17th May 2018 because they are travelling abroad to attend an international conference, hence, requested to adjourn the hearing to another date. Acceding to the request of the Complainant an adjournment was granted.
Through the instant IO Application, the Complainant reiterated the contents of its Complaint that the Respondent is engaged in dissemination of false and misleading information/claims representing it an international corporation selling and serving ""Starbucks"" coffee and allied products in Pakistan; whereas, it has no authorization or license to use the Complainant's registered and well-known trademark ""Starbucks"" and the word mark ""Starbucks Coffee""; thereby, it is deliberately engaged in deceptive marketing practices to the Complainant's and the consumer's detriment in contravention of section 10 of the Act.
The Complainant has prayed that the Commission may pass an interim order under section 32 of the Act requiring the Respondent and the outlets owned and operated by the Respondent to refrain from deceptive marketing practices as explained in the Complaint in order to prevent further irreparable loss and damage to the business and goodwill of the Complainant till the conclusion of the proceedings in the subject complaint.
After considering the Complainant's I.O. Application, vide hearing notice dated 08th August 2018, the parties were informed that the I.O. Application shall be heard on 15th August 2018 and they are required to file their written submissions, if any, on the issue of interim relief under section 32 of the Act. However, no written submission was made by them.","On 15th August 2018, the Complainant and the Respondent through their authorized representatives were heard on the I.O. Application. The submissions/contentions of the Complainant are outlined in brief as follows:
a) In its reply to the SCN dated 4th May 2018, the Respondent has admitted that it was imitating the products such as coffee cups of the Respondent and other coffee houses merely as souvenirs. However, citing the contents of the Enquiry Report, the Complainant asserted that it is an established fact that the Respondent has been marketing, advertising, producing and supplying coffee and other related products' labelling and packaging bearing Starbucks' trademark and logo without any authorization from the Complainant. Further, the Respondent was and continues to use the Complainant's trademark and labelling/packaging on its Facebook page in order to deceive the consumers.
b) The Complainant submitted that in the situation that exists or is likely to emerge, serious or irreparable damage may occur to the Complainant, hence it must be restrained to take any opportunity to ride on the back of the Starbucks brand to attract consumers.
","Till the issuance of the final Order and conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act under Show Cause Notice No. 14 of 2018, the Respondent is directed to refrain from marketing, advertising, producing and supplying coffee and other related products' labelling and packaging bearing Starbucks' trademark and logo anywhere which inter alia include the website and Facebook page, without any authorization from the Complainant; and
The Respondent is directed not to claim any association or affiliation with the Complainant or using the trademarks or logos of the Complainant on any of its marketing material, while selling any of its products, in particular coffee or other related products at any of its Restaurants/Cafes till the conclusion of the proceedings under Section 30 of the Act and until further Orders.
The Respondent is cautioned that in case any violation of the above said directions is committed, the Respondent in pursuance of clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 38 of the Act read with clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act, shall be liable to a fine of Rs.10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million Only). The Respondent is also directed to file the compliance report with reference to the directions given in Para 17 above within seven (7) days from the date of this Order with the Registrar of the Commission without fail.
Needless to say, the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and without prejudice to further proceedings in the instant matter.
In terms of the above, the I.O. Application stands allowed and the Registrar of the Commission is directed to transmit copies of this Order to the concerned parties and also to issue hearing notices to the parties concerned for 11th September, 2018






","The submissions/contentions of the Respondent are summarized as follows:
a) Since 04th April 2018, the Respondent cafe and bakery have been non-operational after the fire broke out on the aforesaid date. Thus, the Respondent is merely operating its restaurant but the cafe and bakery are closed and the Respondent is not serving coffee. 
In the attending circumstances and in pursuance of Regulation 52A of the GER, we deemed it appropriate to seek assistance from Mr. Noman A. Farooqi, Director General (Legal) of the Commission. In attendance and after the submissions of the authorized representatives of the Complainant and Respondent, for assistance of the bench, following submissions were made by him:
a) The Commission initiated the proceedings under section 30 of the Act after considering the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report dated 9th March 2018. The photographs in the Survey, which have not been denied by the Respondent clearly shows that the Respondent is using the Trademarks of the Complainant on its website, Facebook page, outside the Restaurant, inside the Restaurant, on the crockery as well as on the menu card.
b) As far as the claim of the Respondent that the cafe and bakery are closed since 4th April 2018, it was submitted that the Officer of the Commission Mr. Imran Akhter, Senior Assistant visited the premises of the Respondent on 10th August 2018 and the Restaurant was not only operational but coffee was also being served.
c)It was submitted that under section 32 of the Act, the Commission may in any proceedings under section 30 of the Act, (i) where final order is likely to take time, (ii) a situation exists or is likely to emerge, (iii) that situation may cause serious or irreparable damage, and (iv) an interim Order is necessary in the public interest, (v) after giving an opportunity of hearing, may pass an Order directing the undertaking concerned to do or refrain from doing or continuing to do any act or thing specified in the Order.
d) It is on the record that the Trademarks used by the Respondent are in fact registered in the name of the Complainant and the registration certificates are placed as 'Annexure-A' to the Enquiry Report. The Respondents have not placed any document on the record which shows that the trademarks `Starbucks' used by them is infact registered in their name. 
e) In another case reported as Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited v. United Insurance Company of Pakistan Limited, reported as 2016 CLD 1663, the honourable Sindh High Court held that
""...Considering the background of the Plaintiffs' business, it seems that adoption of the same trademark which is phonetically and visually similar and there is likelihood that it would create confusion and deception to the customers of such class...
In my view the defendants have failed to justify bona fide adoption of the word, ""Amaan Plan"" and/or ""Amaan"" as they may have other choices instead of plaintiff's registered mark which has already gained popularity and enjoying a goodwill in the market, hence, I am of the view that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, balance of inconvenience is also in their favour and they would suffer irreparable loss unless the application is allowed as prayed. Accordingly, application is allowed.""
After hearing the Parties we are of the view that the Act was promulgated with the scope to provide free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti-competitive behaviours. As is evident that the interim Order under section 32 of the Act can only be passed upon satisfaction of following conditions:
(i) Final Order in the proceedings is likely to take time,
(ii) A situation exists or is likely to emerge,
(iii) As a consequence of the above situation serious or irreparable damage may occur, and
(iv) Interim Order is necessary in the public interest,
(v) After providing an opportunity of hearing to the concerned undertakings.
we are of the opinion that the issuance of final order in the instant matter may take time, hence, the first condition under section 32 of the Act stands satisfied.
With reference to the second condition, a prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report along with the evidence are available on the record, which inter alia include the registration certificates and the images of the Restaurant and Cafe owned and operated by the Respondent, and the printouts of the Respondents' Facebook page are presented by the Complainant's Counsel showing that the Respondent is using the registered trademark of the Complainant. Thus, we are of the considered view that a, prima facie contravention of clauses (a), (b) and (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act is made out. In this regard we are in agreement with the judgments 2015 CLD 655 and 2016 CLD 1663.
Regarding the third condition, we are guided by the observations made in one of the earlier decisions of the Commission i.e. In the matter of Complaint filed by DHL reported as 2013 CLD 1014:
""It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant 's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents.""
Since, the Respondent is prima facie using the trademark of the Complainant and the trademarks are also registered in the name of the Complainant, proof whereof is placed on the record as an annexure to the Enquiry Report, allowing the Respondent to continue with the use of Complainant's trademark may cause serious or irreparable damage to the business and goodwill of the Complainant.
With reference to the fourth condition, we note that the Commission may issue an Interim Order under section 32 of the Act, where the issuance is in the public interest. Although the term ""public interest"" is not defined under the Act, however, we have taken guidance from the judgment of the honourable High Court in the case Nasrullah v. Province of Balochistan, reported as 2000 PLC (C.S.) 769, wherein the Honourable Court observed as follows:
""The word public interest has not been defined in the statute, therefore, to view of its definition in above quoted citation in our opinion in broader sense this expression can be defined which is action that can be taken to protect the legal rights of the general public or a class of public with whom justice is required to be done by a competent authority keeping in view the relevant rules and laws available on the subject. In this behalf it is also to be added that competent authority though enjoys jurisdiction to adjudge in view of the prevailing circumstance to do or not to do a particular act in the public interest but at the same time care should be taken that such act may not cause injustice to some or majority of the members of the public who are also entitled equally for protection of a law/rules under which action has been taken.""
As mentioned earlier, the Commission is entrusted with the role of protecting the consumers from anti-competitive behaviours which inter alia include the deceptive marketing practices being prohibited under Section 10 of the Act. Further, the Commission is right in its steed to restrain the undertakings from resorting to unfair competitive practice such like using someone else's trademark and that too a registered trademark without any authorization or license, which may not only harm the business interest of the owner of trade mark but will also deceive the consumers in making them believe that the products which they have purchased belonged to or is associated with the owner of trademark, which in fact is not the case. Hence, we are of the considered view that the fourth condition also stands satisfied in the instant matter.",HBT/9/CCOP Application allowed.,Allowed.

MESSRS SHAINAL AL-SYED FOODS FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:"," In the matter of
File No. 205/OFT/SHAINAL/CCP/2015, decided on 30th March, 2018.
",,,"The Complainant is a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 in Pakistan since 19 February 1970. It is engaged in the business of production, marketing and sale of a large variety (more than a hundred types) of food products at affordable prices, including but not limited to, dessert preparation mixtures, custards, jams, jellies, marmalades, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, sauces, recipe masalas, salts, snacks, spices and other ingredients (hereinafter the 'Complainant's Products').
4. The Complainant submitted that it has been using the word 'National' as a trademark, house mark and company name since 1970. Additionally it was stated that it has been using this registered trademark as a logo (copyright protected). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent started preparing, packing, marketing and selling imitated food products (hereinafter the ""Respondent's Products"") using a confusingly similar logo ""Shainal"" and packaging in terms of colour scheme, design and overall get up, to that of the Complainant's Products. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the following of its food products along with its product labelling and packaging were being imitated by the word National. 
With regard to the above allegations, an enquiry in terms of Section 37(2) of the Act was initiated by the Commission. The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""6.1 It appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, does amount to passing off its products as that of the Complainant's through fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and get up of products, in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) which prohibits fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging.
6.2 In view of the analysis, it also appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, has the potential to inflict harm upon the goodwill and business interest of the Complainant in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(a) and (b).
6.3 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large. 
Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Enquiry Report, the Commission approved the initiation of proceedings under Section 30 of the Act against the Respondent. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
""WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 in specific, it appears that the fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and getup of products by the Undertaking constitutes a prima facie violation of Section 10 (1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the fraudulent use of another's product labelling and packaging; and
WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.18 to 5.26 in specific, it appears that the Undertaking's conduct is not only capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant but also amounts to the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, which prima facie constitutes violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively;""

","The issues for determination identified by the Commission are as follows:
A. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act through the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
B. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(b) of the Act through the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including information which lacks a reasonable basis, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
C. Whether, the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(a) through the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
","We note that during the enquiry as well as during the proceedings before the Commission the Respondent was given substantial time to amend/ revise its trade dress, however, no credible effort was made by the Respondent to change its trade dress and make it distinct from that of the Complainant. Hence, keeping in view the above, we are constrained to impose a penalty of PKR. 5,000,000/- (Rupees Five Million Only) on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
The Respondent is hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behaviour in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to cease and desist from the use of its Trade Dress (previous and revised submitted to the Commission) which is subject matter of this Order and similar to the Complainant's Trade Dress and Trade Mark, with immediate effect and not to use it in future. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's Trade Dress. The Respondent is also directed to file within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene any provision of the Act, in particular Section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondent shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of Section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
In terms of the above, SCN No. 34 /2016 is hereby disposed of.

","ISSUE A: 
According to Section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In simple terms, the mischief that Section 10 seeks to remedy is consumer deception. The Commission has established time and again that the term ""consumer"" is to be construed as the ordinary consumer for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act, reference in this regard is placed on 'in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zong reported as 2010 CLD 1478, wherein the Commission observed that 'restricting its interpretation with the use of the words `average', 'reasonable ' or 'prudent' will not only narrow down and put constraints on the effective implementation of the provision it would rather be contrary to the intent of law.
In its Order dated 8 February 2016 in the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. A Rahim Foods and reported as 2016 CLD 1128, the Commission expounded upon the concept of ""parasitic copying"" being an inherent part of the fraudulent use of another's product labeling and packaging. More specifically, the following explanation of parasitic copying demonstrates aptly the crucial aspects of the practice:
""Indeed parasitic copying typically consists in reproducing the main presentational features of market leading products (such as the shape of the product or of its packaging, color combination and graphic arrangement) but usually there is just enough difference to avoid a clear cut trade mark infringement.
Furthermore, the Commission is guided by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which contains provisions designed to tackle copycat packaging that misleads or confuses consumers. Article (1)(b) of the directive bans, commercial practices misleading consumers in relation to the main characteristics of the product, including its commercial origin. Article (2)(a), which is specifically dedicated to confusing marketing. Guided by the above general principles and adopting a holistic approach, the Commission's observations, on a juxtaposition of the images of the Complainant's Trade Dress and Respondent's Trade Dress are as follows:
i. There is no doubt that a pictorial comparison of the Complainant's Products and Respondent's Products leads to the obvious conclusion that there exist deceptively confusing similarities in the Complainant's Trade Dress and the Respondent's Trade Dress, almost to the extent of being identical but for the different brand names evident on the packaging.
As regards the allegation pertaining to the use of the name ""Shainal"" by the Respondent, it is observed that the same is a derivative of the brand name of two of the oldest market players, the Complainant i.e. ""National"" and ""Shan"". The name ""Shainal"" is a homophone of the brand name ""National"" in general and a combination of the words 'Shan' and National' in specific.
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of Section 10(1) in terms of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act to the extent of the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress.
ISSUE B: 
With respect to this issue, the Commission is required to determine whether the Respondent's copycat packaging of the Complainant's Trade Dress, also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to consumers within the scope of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.
Clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods; constitutes a deceptive marketing practice.
The terms ""misleading"" information has been interpreted by the Commission in the case reported as 2010 CLD 1478, as follows:
Misleading information: ""may essentially include oral or written statements or representations that are: (a) capable of giving wrong impression or idea, (b) likely to lead into error of conduct, thought or judgment, (c) tends to misinform or misguide owing to vagueness or any omission, (d) may or may not be deliberate or conscious, and (e) in contrast to false information, it has less erroneous connotation and is somewhat open to interpretation as the circumstances and conduct of a party may be treated as relevant to a certain extent"".
The Commission now considers the term 'reasonable basis' in light of section 10 of the Act. The concept of having a reasonable basis is an established doctrine in USA which was first recognised in the case of Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972).
In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the aforementioned conduct of the Respondent has resulted in a violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2) (b) of the Act, as the Respondent is disseminating misleading information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis, in the form of the confusing similarities of Respondent's Trade Dress to that of the Complainant's Trade Dress, thereby misleading the consumers as to the origin and place of production of the product.
ISSUE C: 
Clause (a) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information that it is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' shall be deemed to constitute a deceptive marketing practice.
This provision constitutes two main elements (i) the dissemination of false or misleading information (ii) that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking.
With reference to proving the actual harm caused to a competitors business interest, the Commission in its Order in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Jotun Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited reported as 2015 CLD 1638, stated that, actual harm to a competitors business interest need not be established to make out a violation in terms of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, the very presence of a deceptive market practice that has the potential to cause harm to the competitor's business is in fact sufficient to hold the Respondent culpable.
As per the ruling laid down by the Commission in the 2016 CLD 1128, ""in the event that there exists a contravention of Section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out"". Furthermore, as established above, copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, in itself also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to the public as it amounts to an unfair and deceptive trading practice. 
Based on the above, the Commission is of the considered opinion that, Respondent's practice of parasitic copying of the Complainant's Trade Dress, which appreciably impairs the consumer's ability to make an informed decision due to confusing similarities between the Respondent's Products and the Complainant's Products, being inherently deceptive, is in fact capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in contravention of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.",HBT/8/CCOP Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

Raja ASIR MUNIR and another---Appellants
Versus
Messrs DHL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED and 2 others---Respondents

","Appeals Nos. 1 and 2 of 2013, decided on 23rd May, 2017.",,"AHMED OWAIS PIRZADA, MEMBER TECHNICAL.","Briefly the background of the appeals is that the Competition Commission of Pakistan received a complaint from respondent No. 1, alleging fraudulent use of its stylized and artistically created logo trademark by the appellants without any permission or authorization or consent of the respondent, which being false, deceptive and misleading and also capable of harming its business was in violation to the provision of section 10 of the Act. The Commission conducted an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Act, concluding that both the appellants used the logo, which were identical in colour and style of the complainant's trademark on the bill board/hording/sign board for advertisement, which prima facie gave an impression that the appellants were authorized dealers of the complainant, which was not correct impression, hence such use of mark which was identical to the respondent's trademark, prima facie was misleading the consumer and was also capable of harming the business interest of the respondent in violation of section 10 of the Act. The report recommended that the conduct of the appellants warranted initiation of proceedings against them under section 30 of the Act.
3. Based on the prima facie findings of the inquiry report, show cause notices were issued to the appellants on 22nd February, 2012, pursuance to which appellants and all other parties were afforded an opportunity of a detailed hearing. Finally the Competition Commission of Pakistan concluded that the manner in which marks under question were printed and advertised look deceptively similar to that of respondent's trademark. Consequently the appellants were penalized vide order dated 21st December, 2012 which had been impugned in the instant appeals.
4. In their appeals the appellants stated that the impugned order dated 21st December, 2012, passed by Competition Commission of Pakistan was illegal, against the law and facts of the case on record and passed arbitrarily. It was stated that neither font, colour did have any resemblance with the respondent's trademark nor style has any similarity with the styled trademark of the respondent. It was further stated that the impugned order was without jurisdiction and not sustainable in the eyes of law. The appellants stated in their appeals that the inquiry report and even the order passed had failed to bear out any misleading information being passed by the appellants or any impression which was basically different from actual one, in clear term there was no deception in using the word IDHS international couriers. The appellants stated in their appeals that from the plain language of section 10(b) of the Competition Act, it was apparent that the lawmakers divided the allegation in to distribution of false or misleading information and distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis related to character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or quality of goods while in the instant case there is no distribution of any false or misleading information and no such information was passed on to the customers regarding the DHL World Wide Express, which affected the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or concern the qualities of goods. The appellants took the position that the complaint was not properly instituted, signed and verified by the competent and authorized person. PLD 1971 Supreme Court page 550 was referred in this behalf. Further, the complaint, which was filed with wrong name of the appellant's company, was not having affidavit with it before the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It was stated that the appellants were neither using the trademark nor distributing false or misleading information regarding the fact that the appellants were authorized/permitted by the respondent. It was further stated that very important questions of law and facts were involved in the matter which could not be adjudicated upon without recording the evidence of both the parties. The pleadings were itself not evidence, it should be proved after recording evidence which was not brought on record.
5. Learned counsel for IDHS while reiterating the position taken in the appeal stated that ""IDHS international couriers"" was a trademark having trademark No-333053 and applied copy right registration with the concerned department. The trademark authority and the copy right authority under the relevant legislation has power upon the case where DHL World Wide Express registered its trademark and copyrights, therefore, the order in the given circumstances was without jurisdiction. Learned counsel further stated that the appellant never accepted, received, dispatched or delivered the goods with the name of respondent. The appellant never presented himself as agent, distributor or employee of the respondent. The learned counsel further stated that the appellant neither developed a web page, letter head, visiting cards, pamphlets, brushers, leaflets, booklets, e-mail ID by the name of respondent nor found in any correspondence or communications with the name of respondent with any third party. Thus the inquiry report, show cause notice and the subsequent order is without any basis lacking material evidence and liable to be set aside in the interest of justice.
","After completing the aforesaid exercise we are of the view that the following issues are to be examined for orders.
(i) Whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
(ii) Whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 and
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
(iii) Whether the order of the Competition Commission is bad in the eyes of law.
","In the circumstances, after analyzing the relevant facts and material available on record, we have come to the conclusion that finding recorded by Competition Commission of Pakistan are based on proper appraisal of relevant provisions of Competition Law as well as other material brought on record. The same are, therefore, maintained.
The appeals of the appellants, therefore, being devoid of merits are dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

 
","The issue that whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person has thoroughly been examined by the Competition Commission of Pakistan, however since the same has again been raised by the appellants, therefore, we have also looked into it. The perusal of record reveals that Mr. Nouman Anwer Butt raised the issue that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, it was noted that the complaint was filed by the Company Secretary namely Mr. Muhammad Haneef Idrees, which was not only bearing the signatures but also beard the seal of the respondent's undertaking. A certified true copy of Board Resolution No. 12/2011 by circulation passed on 17th August, 2011 was also annexed with the complaint. In the said Board Resolution along with Company Secretary, Mr. Sarfaraz Sadiqui, Chief Executive Officer of the company was also authorized on behalf of company in the matter to take all necessary measures, required in this regard before the Competition Commission of Pakistan and all courts, arbitrators, Tribunal, Forum or Administrative Authority in relation to the said matter. 
Before examining the remaining issues including contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act, we would like to deal with certain objections raised by the respondents. The trademark authority and the copyright authority under the relevant legislation have the power upon the case where ""DHL World Wide Express"" registered its trademark and copy right, therefore, the impugned order in the given circumstances is without jurisdiction. The aforesaid issue has been examined and it has been observed that involvement of a person in violation of provisions of the Competition Act provides necessary jurisdiction to the Commission to take cognizance in such type of situation for necessary orders. In these circumstances, the objection raised by Raja Asir Munir is totally uncalled for and unjustified.
Now coming to the issue that whether the appellants have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general or in particular, learned counsel for IDHS and DHIL have been asked to explain the logical reasoning and justification for adoption of marks IDHS and DHIL, however both of them could not give any justification which could be considered convincing to have mark almost identical to DHL. On the other hand a company was incorporated by three friends, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn having DHL as an essential part of company name and also used as a trademark. It is, therefore, observed that mark having resemblance with DHL is intentionally selected to confuse the market. Again the aforesaid logo has a lot of similarity with DHL.
As regards the contravention of the provision of the section 10 of the Act in general or particular, one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trademark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. To analyze the provision of section 10 more conveniently the said section 10(2)(d) is reproduced as below:-
""fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name and product labeling or packaging""
Coming to the third issue that whether the order of the Competition Commission of Pakistan is bad in the eyes of law being against the fact and passed arbitrarily. The appellants have failed to explain as to why and how the order passed by the Competition Commission could be illegal and how it is against the law and facts of the case and passed arbitrarily. Such statements without any cogent arguments and corroborative case law remain inconsequential to the appeals. Further the contention of the appellants that the Competition Commission has passed the order without having jurisdiction to do so is incorrect. It is observed that since the appellants have been involved in violation of the provisions of Competition Act, 2010, therefore, the Commission has the necessary jurisdiction and the case has been validly and competently filed and decided by the Commission.

ITALFARMACO S.P.A.---Petitioner
Versus
HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","C.O. No. 751 of 2010, decided on 17th May, 2017.",,,"An application under section 90(1)(b)(i) and section 80(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance"") has been filed by the applicant-company Italfarmaco S.P.A, a company existing under the laws of Italy through its authorized signatory (""the applicant""). The application has been filed for a declaration of invalidity of the entry in the Trademark Register of the trademark FERPLEX registered under No.130807 dated July 11, 1995 in class 5 for pharmaceutical preparations used as iron supplement. The trademark FERPLEX (""the trademark"") has been registered in the name of the respondent No.1 Himont Pharmaceuticals (""Himont"").
A license agreement dated 26.10.1994 was executed between the applicant and Himont regarding the manufacturing and sale of the trademark. The agreement is annexed with the application. The primary facts which form the foundation of the application are not in dispute between the parties and the parties are on common ground with regard thereto. Thus, the registration of the trademark in the name of Himont since the year 1996 was within the knowledge of the applicant and the position continued to subsist until the filing of the application for declaring the trademark as invalid. The license agreement between the parties was terminated by the applicant vide termination letter dated 27.4.2009.
It can be seen from a reading of the prayer clause of the suit filed by Himont that the suit seeks a declaration ""regarding the trademark FERPLEX"". The suit by Himont also seeks a declaration to the effect that exclusive agreement between the applicant and Himont is still valid and enforceable as also that Himont has the sole right to manufacture, market, supply, distribute and sale of the product FERPLEX in Pakistan. On 6.9.2010, the applicant also filed a suit before the District Court, Lahore under the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by the Ordinance. The suit by the applicant is for the grant of permanent injunction seeking to restrain Himont purportedly from infringing and using the trademark FERPLEX. Therefore, the suit by the applicant is also with regard to the trademark which is the subject matter of this application as well. It would be expedient to reproduce the prayer made in the suit by the applicant, which is as follow:-
""This honourable Court may further be pleased to pass/grant/direct:
a) An order directing the Defendant to recall all the stocks of its products from the market being sold under the imitated trademark FERPLEX as well as for destruction or replacement of the labels, plates, markings thereof along with destruction or handing over to the plaintiff for destruction of all the offending labels, plates, markings and other printed material bearing the imitated trademark FERPLEX.
b) To remove all figures, hoarding, boards, neon signs etc., bearing imitated trademark FERPLEX.
c) An order directing the Defendant to get all its Marketing Approval/Drug Registration for imitated trademark FERPLEX transferred to the name of the plaintiff.
d) Any other relief that this honourable Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the present case.""
Once again, it is evident from the prayer reproduced above that the injunction has been sought with regard to the trademark FERPLEX and ancillary reliefs have been asked for which inter alia include an order directing the defendant to have all its marketing approval/drug registration transferred to the name of the applicant.","It is correct that Himont was a licensee of the applicant under a license agreement executed on 26.10.1994. The agreement has effectively been terminated w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Himont alleges that the agreement could not be terminated and has brought a suit before the District Court, Lahore. The parties are at variance with regard to the fact whether the agreement gave the power to Himont to have the trademark registered in its name. The parties are poles apart on the interpretation put on the different clauses of the license agreement with regard to this aspect. The applicant asserts that by the license agreement, Himont was merely conferred a license for the use of trademark FERPLEX within the territory of Pakistan. The applicant provided requisite data and information to Himont to enable it to obtain marketing approval/drug registration under the trademark FERPLEX and based on the information and data provided by the applicant, Himont succeeded in obtaining market registration from the applicant for formulating, manufacturing and selling the FERPLEX products as licensee of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the trademark was registered with the Registrar of Trademark in the name of Himont and the current application has been made by the applicant to declare as invalid the registration of the trademark."," In view of the above, C.M No.1-C of 2011 is allowed. The application is hereby returned to the applicant to be filed before the appropriate forum.
","Two grounds form the nub of the applicant's arguments with regard to the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by Himont. These grounds revolve around the true construction of provisions of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. Firstly, the learned counsel states that in fact no proceedings are pending with the District Court within the contemplation of the term as used in subsection (4) and thus, the exception to subsection (4) is not attracted so as to convince this Court to allow the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. Secondly, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the purposive construction of subsection (4) was that the choice to approach the appellate forum was retained by the applicant who brings an application under section 80 for seeking a declaration of invalidity with regard to a trademark.
the application may be made by an interested party either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thus far, the choice lies with an interested party to file an application either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thereafter follows an exception which has been provided in subsection (4). In terms of that exception if the proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court the application shall be made to the High Court or a District Court. The learned counsel for the applicant laid great stress on the aspect that the proceedings before the District Court were not proceedings within the ambit of the term as used in clause 'a' of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. This submission of the learned counsel is nuanced and has no legal legs to stand upon. The term 'proceedings' is a compendious term and includes all or any causes which are brought before the courts and on which the courts can undertake judicial proceedings. It would suffice to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as the State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) for an elaboration to the term 'proceedings'. It was held that:-
""Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, interpretation of the word 'proceeding' as interpreted in various pronouncements given above, we are of the opinion that the word 'proceedings' is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" means the instituting or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a 'proceeding' is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or judicial officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an action.""
The learned counsel for the applicant attempted to make a subtle distinction on an issue which arises peripherally from the first submission made by the learned counsel with regard to the meaning of the term 'proceedings'. He stated that the proceedings before the District Court were not regarding the use of the trademark but merely sought the cancellation of the registration of the drug with the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan. n order to understand the proposition raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, the prayers made in the suits filed by the parties before the District Court, Lahore have been brought forth above. In this application, the prayer is to the effect that the trademark registration be declared as invalid in terms of section 90(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and in the alternate it has been prayed that registration of trademarks be rectified by substituting the name of the applicant as the proprietor of the registered trademark. Therefore, the entire prayer of the applicant constitutes a request for a declaration of invalidity with regard to the trademark registered in the name of Himont. If we were to juxtapose the prayers made in this application with the one made by Himont in its suit before District Court, Lahore it would become evident that Himont has prayed for the converse of what the applicant has prayed in the instant application. 
It is under these circumstances that inter alia a declaration has been sought in the suit for the continued use of the trademark FERPLEX by Himont as also for a declaration that any use of the trademark FERPLEX by any party including the defendant shall be an act of unfair competition and in violation of Himont's commercial and equitable rights. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any of its agents from obstructing the business of Himont has also been sought. More importantly, a decree for permanent injunction has been sought restraining the applicant herein either directly or indirectly from using the trademark FERPLEX in Pakistan in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the relief claimed in the suit filed by Himont is in conflict and directly contrary to what has been asked for in the present application. 
The learned counsel for the applicant made a reference to section 72 of the Trademark Act, 1940 and referred to the words ""as the case may be"" as used in section 72 of the Act, 1940. He also referred to section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 in which in subsection (4)(a) while making a similar exception the legislature has used the words ""as the case may be"". Precisely, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the absence of these words has left a choice with the applicant to make the application to either the High Court or the District Court. This argument by the learned counsel will virtually have the effect of nullifying the intention of the legislature in providing an exception and will make the entire exception as redundant. It is trite principle and a rule of construction that redundancy cannot be attached to any provisions enacted by the legislature. If the argument of the learned counsel were to be accepted, this will mean that the application may be filed with the High Court or a District Court irrespective of the proceedings pending in the High Court or a District Court. This will have the unholy effect of making a mockery of the law and, therefore, such an interpretation could not be countenanced.
The wrongness of the argument is also evident from a consideration of the provisions of section 73 of the Ordinance. Section 73, so far as relevant, reads as under:-
73(4) An application for revocation may be made by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-
a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in case the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Subsection (4) confers the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for revocation on the Registrar. Thus, and it requires to be reemphasized, the power vests in the Registrar and nor in either the High Court or the District Court. 
The exception is couched in broad terms. The words ""if proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or, the District Court "" evince a broad-based and wide-ranging concept which is inclusive. From the meaning of the term 'proceedings' brought out in the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, there is no doubt that it embraces within it the suits filed by the parties before the District Court and the current application too. But the key word in any opinion is 'concerning'. It connotes all or any proceedings even remotely touching upon the trademark in question. The word renders the entire concept fluid and plastic without being hedged in, in any manner. If the proceedings are brought under the provisions of the Ordinance, they are necessarily proceedings concerning trademark, whether they arise out of a contact or are brought for revocation of registration or for declaring as invalid the registration of a trademark. In this case, Himont resists the application for invalidity, tooth and nail. It seeks both the license agreement and the registration to be declared as valid in the suit before the District Court. The applicant says that retention of the registration of trademark is not a specific prayer in the suit filed by Himont. That may be so but the effect of declaring the license agreement to be subsisting and valid would have the consequence of impacting the question of registration too and there is no escape from it. The use of the word 'shall' too lends actuality to the analysis and clearly brings forth the mandatory nature of the provision.
As if this was not enough, the legislature enacted section 116 to reinforce the purpose of bringing in the exception in subsection (4) of section 80. Section 116 is to the following effect:-
""116. Procedure in certain cases of option to apply to the High Court, a District Court or the Registrar- Where under this Ordinance, an applicant has the option of making an application either to the High Court or a District Court or to the Registrar-
a) if any suit or proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending before the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in any other case, if the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Once again, section 116 conceptualises the same statutory enterprise and is an overarching provision which applies to all applications made under the Ordinance. It seeks to attain the same end, that is, all decisions concerning a trademark should be consistent and made by the same forum.
The learned counsel for the applicant relied upon Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Rafiuddin v. Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 2 others (1994 MLD 874) and Iqbal Begum v. Farooq Inayat and others (PLD 1993 Lahore 183). These judgments elaborate upon the concept and contours of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary to allude to these precedents as the concept is very well settled and the issue regarding the applicability or otherwise of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. does not arise as it is not denied that in these proceedings the general provisions of civil procedure apply and in case this Court comes to the conclusion that the present proceedings are caught by the mischief of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance, this Court has the power to make necessary directions in order to give effect to those provisions and there is no cavil with this proposition.
The learned counsel for Himont referred to Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833) which was a case concerning application under section 73 of the Ordinance for the revocation of the trademark. It was held in this judgment that the application ought to be filed with the Registrar and the only exception which allows the filing of such an application before the High Court if proceedings were already pending with the High Court. This precedent can be cited as a complete answer to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has a choice to file the proceedings either before the High Court or before the District Court. Messrs H & B, General Trading Company through Director v. Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028) is a Division Bench judgment of the Karachi High Court which held that proceedings under sections 73 and 80 of the Ordinance require such proceedings to be filed before the forum where proceedings concerning the trademark is already pending. This judgment is on all fours with the facts in the instant application and primarily supports the findings rendered in the instant application. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that all such proceedings must be decided by the same forum and this was based on sound principles of administration of justice and judicial governance and proceeded thereafter to return the application to be filed at the proper forum. The appeal before the Division Bench arose out of a judgment of the Single Bench of the Karachi High Court reported as 2009 CLC 354 which substantially arrived at the same conclusion which was affirmed by the Division Bench.",KMZ/I-18/L Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE ISSUED TO MESSRS SOCIETY OF ACCOUNTING EDUCATION FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:
"," In the matter of
File No. 185/OFT/CFA/CCP/2015, decided on 14th December, 2016.",,,"The Complainant is a non-stock corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, United States of America. The company is engaged in imparting education and training to students and professionals in the field of investment and financial analysis and has gradually extended its operations around the world, including Pakistan. The Respondent is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 of Pakistan and is engaged in the provision of educational services in the field of finance and accounting. Both are undertaking in terms of section 2(1)(q) of the Act.
3. The Complainant has alleged that the Respondent has been using the Complainant's registered Trademark 'CFA' to deceive public and promote its business. It further alleged that the Respondent had resorted to the dissemination of false or misleading information, which is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant. Moreover, it alleged that the Respondent had been distributing false or misleading information by unauthorized use of imitated marks as CFA, ACFA, FCFA, DCFA, as if the Respondent was authorized/permitted by the Complainant to use the mark 'CFA' by the Complainant as such.
4. An enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated in the matter, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 04 March 2015 (the 'Enquiry Report').
After considering the Enquiry Report, the Commission issued the SCN to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before Commission on 02 June 2015. The relevant parts of the SCN are reproduced hereinbelow:
""AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, it appears that the Undertaking began using the Impugned Mark, and variations of it, in relation to its own educational enterprise in 2010, without the Complainant's authorization;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 19 in particular, the Complainant sent the Undertaking cease and desist letters in February 2011, in response to which the Respondent modified its website and eliminated references to be Impugned Mark for a certain time period;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, the Undertaking resumed its use of the Impugned Mark and its variations in 2012 which continued until the time of the complaint in 2013;
8. AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 6, 22 and 23 in particular, while it appears that the Undertaking has now modified the mark depicted on its website, it remains misleadingly similar to the Impugned Mark;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that through the use of the Impugned Mark and deceptively similar variations of the same, the Undertaking is prima facie distributing false and misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, the Undertaking is involved in providing and advertising its services through the use of the Impugned Mark which prima facie amounts to distributing false and misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods, which constitutes a prima facie violation of section 10(2)(b) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that the Undertaking's use of the Complainant's Impugned Mark prima facie amounts to fraudulent use of another's trademark, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act.""
","The following issues have been identified for deliberation and decision:
a) Whether or not the presence of a suit for permanent injunction against infringement of trademarks bars the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Act and hence the proceedings?
b) Whether or not the alleged advertisements, marketing material, and trademarks used by the Respondent constitute deceptive marketing practices in terms of section 10 of the Act?
","The Commission hereby directs the Respondent to immediately cease the use of the mark 'CFA' in any form whatsoever.
The Respondent is further directed to cease the use of terms 'DCFA, ACFA, FCFA, and CFAs.' or any other similar acronyms and terms, in any form and to amend its promotional and marketing material accordingly.
Furthermore, the Respondent is directed to amend its Article and Memorandum of Association to remove any reference to the abovementioned terms.
For each of the four violations stated above, a penalty of PKR 0.5 million is imposed on the Respondent for a total of PKR 2 million.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar to the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order and is reprimanded from indulging in deceptive marketing practices in future as at the risk of severe penal consequences.
The penalties and direction hereinabove have been imposed after taking into account the seriousness and length of the violations and its impact on the consumers and the interests of the competing undertakings, and are proportionate to the contraventions of section 10 of the Act and necessary to restore the fair competition in the relevant market.
In terms of the above, SCN No.01/2015 is hereby disposed of.

","With respect to the first issue, it is clarified that the subject proceedings before the Commission do not have any nexus with the suit proceedings pending before the learned Additional District and Session Judge as highlighted by the Respondent. It has been observed by Commission in its Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to M/s. Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for Deceptive Marketing Practices that the pendency of a civil suit or principle of ""res sub judice"" as enunciated in section 10 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (the 'C.P.C.') has no relevance to Commission's proceedings under the Act. The relevant part of the order is as follow:
""Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of 'res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision, as explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits' pending in 'courts'.
Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi- judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'court' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court.""
Based on the above, a suit for a permanent injunction regarding infringement of trademarks is a different subject than the one being considered by the Commission i.e. whether or not the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the Complainants trademark for the purpose of misleading consumers and distorting competition.

With respect to the second issue the Complainant has submitted documentary evidence of its 'applications of registration' and 'registration of Trade Mark' in the Trademark under TR No's. 196401, 196402, 136436 and 964000 which establishes the Complainant's exclusive right to mark CFA denoting Chartered Financial Analyst. The Respondent has used different advertising schemes by using the mark CFA for the promotion of its institute/courses, which has never been contested by the Respondent, both during the enquiry and the proceedings.
The Commission directed the Respondent in hearing on 2 June 2015 to submit its Memorandum and Article of Association. Upon analyzing the Memorandum and Article of Association. the following references relevant to the matter at hand were found:
a. The clause (i) of section 4 of Memorandum of Association of the Respondent states, ""the Society will award the membership as Certified Financial Accountants (CFA) and its associates and fellowship"".
b. The interpretation clause (1) of section 1 of Article of Association states, ""Profession means the profession of the business of Certified Financial Accountants (CFA)"".
19. It is also pertinent to mention here that Respondent on receiving the cease and desist letters on 21 March 2011 from Complainant, changed the designatory letters from CFA to CFAc in August 2013 for its Certified Financial Accountants program.
20. The above claims and the evidence available on the record clearly establish that the Respondent used the registered trademark of the Complainant i.e., CFA in its marketing and other materials. The images retrieved from the Respondent's website, the advertisements in newspapers, the evidence or record substantiate Complainant's assertions.
With regard to contravention of Section 10 of the Act, it is noted that the Commission in its Order In The Matter Of Show Cause Notices Issued to Paint Manufacturers (Taint Order') has observed that:
""...for the purposes of deceptive Marketing, actual deception need not be shown to carry the burden of proof it is sufficient to establish that the advertisement has the tendency to deceive and capacity to mislead.""
Furthermore, the Commission has observed in its Order In The Matter Of Complaint filed by Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd.
""It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely effect goodwill will and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant 's business interest...""
For the above reasons, in order to constitute a violation of section 10, the marketing and advertising must have the ability to deceive. 
Furthermore, in relation to section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the principle, the Commission has established the fraudulent use is not the ""subjective intent"" but the ""objective manifestation"" of that intent. 
In view of the above, the usage of the Complaints trademark 'CFA' amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information by the Respondent capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act. At the same time, as discussed above, the usage of the trademark also amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information to consumers in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(b) of the Act.
The marks used by the Respondent FCFA, DCFA, ACFA and CFAc, containing the words ""F"", ""D"", ""A"" and ""Ac"" stand respectively for Fellow, Diploma, Associate, and Accountants. Therefore the words ""F"", ""D"" and ""A"" used in the Complainant's trademark 'CFA' connote the idea that these courses are offered by the Complainant. An ordinary consumer i.e., the students of accounting and finance who would join the world renowned institute of complainant i.e., CFA, would likely be misled by these words and connotations and is highly likely to consider the Respondents institute as authorized by the Complainant. This is based on fact and the Commission's earlier decisions quoted above that the ordinary consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyze it minutely. In similar vein, the use of the letter `c' in minuscule Form with the registered trademark of the Complainant is capable of misleading the ordinary consumer.
In view of the above, the Commission holds that by using the above-noted variation of the 'CFA' the Respondent has violated section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

","Crl. Org. No. 28 of 2016, decided on 19th February, 2016.",,,"Through this criminal original, the petitioner has prayed for initiating contempt proceedings against the respondent for allegedly disobeying the order of this Court dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondent had given an undertaking before this Court which is recorded in its order dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015 that he will confine his business under his trademark (Mark-A) which is registered in respect of goods and not in relation to providing services. He further submits that as the trademark of the respondent is only registered for goods, he cannot use it ostensibly for restaurant services etc.","When quarried as to whether there is any prohibition under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, or any Act or law which is applicable in Pakistan to prevent use of an unregistered trademark or a service mark, learned counsel cannot point out any such provision or law. The Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 lays down provisions for registration of 'trademark' as well as 'service mark'. If an original owner of a trademark fails to register its trademark in relation to its services, he cannot be taken to task for that failure. The respondent is not infringing the trademark of the petitioner or the rights of any other person rather in the previous round of litigation in F.A.O. No.29/2015 it was the respondent who claimed infringement of his trademark by the petitioner. In that appeal, the petitioner was found at fault as such, he was directed to make changes in his trademark in order to prevent confusion and deception amongst the consumers/general public.","This criminal original is, therefore, dismissed with a cost of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand only) to be deposited by the petitioner in the Dispensary of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, within one month from the date of this order, receipt whereof will be deposited with Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court for placing on this file, otherwise it would be collected as arrears of land. Office will place this file in the Chamber on May 23, 2016 as a ""compliance case"".
","Be that as it may, I find that no undertaking was given by the respondent before this Court on 01.06.2015 in F.A.O. No.29/2015 for not using its registered trademark in relation to services. The bona fide use of an unregistered trademark cannot be restricted in relation to a lawful business being conducted by a bona fide owner of the said business as long as the said trademark is not in conflict with the rights of a third party or against the provisions of any law in force at that time. Similarly, a registered trademark can also be used, even though, it has not been registered in relation to corresponding or some other services as long as the use in relation to said services does not infringe the rights of a third party or is contrary to any law being in force in the country at that time. Learned counsel for the petitioner has miserably failed to bring out a case of contempt against the respondent.","

Messrs SHAUKAT SOAP AND GHEE INDUSTRIES (PVT.) LTD.---Appellant
 
Versus
 
Messrs SHAUKAT BROTHERS SOAP MANUFACTURERS (PVT.) LTD.---Respondent

"," 
F.A.O. No. 157 of 2015, decided on 27th May, 2015.",,,"This appeal under section 104 of the C.P.C. has been filed by Messrs Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") through its Chief Executive Mr. Habib Ahmad against the order dated 19.2.2015, passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala in Civil Suit No.2 of 2012 whereby application of the appellant filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction against Messrs Shaukat Brothers Soap Manufacturers (Pvt.) Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as ""the respondent"") has been dismissed.
The background of the case is that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction against the respondent. Along with the suit it filed an application for temporary injunction. In the suit it was averred that the appellant's Trade Mark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" is registered under Registration Nos.25850 dated 30.6.1956 and 44332 (in Class 3) dated 8.11.1965 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Trade Mark""). The said Trade Mark registrations were originally obtained in the name of Abdul Ghani, Abdul Hamid, Manzoor Ahmed, Muhammad Siddique, Mushtaq Ahmed trading as Shaukat Soap Factory, Thanewala Bazar, Gujranwala. According to the extract of the certified copy of the registration No.44332, pursuant to a request for change of ownership on Form No. TM-24, on 15th August, 1979 Messrs Shaukat Soap Factory Ltd. having the same address was registered as the subsequent proprietor of the Trademark w.e.f. 9.8.1972. Based on the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company filed along with the suit it has been submitted that the company incorporated in the name of Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., the appellant, has taken over the running business and concern carried out at Gujranwala in the name and style of Shaukat Soap Factory; that this subsequent merger is being recorded with the Trademarks Registry and the appellant claims that it is the true and bona fide owner of the aforesaid Trademark and that it has the exclusive right under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 to use or authorize the use of the aforesaid Trademark.
The respondent on the other hand contested the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction by contending that the Trademark Registration Nos.25850 and 44332 for the registration of the words ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" are invalid as these words cannot be considered to be of a distinctive character under section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 and that the word ""SHAUKAT"" is a surname according to its ordinary significance; that the said word cannot be registered as a Trademark as it is free to be used by anyone who has the name Shaukat. The respondent further asserted that the Trademark ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" is a distinctive Trademark and sufficiently different from the Trademark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" so there is no possibility of any confusion or deception in the market.
At the time of the decision of the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. the above said factual background and information/material was available with the learned Additional District Judge. However, in her impugned judgment she has proceeded to decide the matter on the ground that there is very minor similarity between the trademarks ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" and ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" as there is only a common usage of colour yellow by the respondents similar to those of the appellant on their wrapper in which the soap is packed. She has relied on the case law reported as Messrs Super Asia v. Anwar Industries (2007 CLD 1181) stating that it has been held in the said case that the trademark ""Asia"" and ""Super Asia"" were held to be different names and not confusingly similar. Lastly she has observed that both the parties are real brothers and since they have inherited the business, as such they have similar rights and claims on the basis of which it has been held in the impugned judgment that the appellant has failed to establish a good prima facie arguable case and, therefore, observed that there was no need to discuss other ingredients for the grant of temporary injunction","The stance of learned counsel for the respondent that the trademark ""SHAUKAT"" is hit by section 6(1)(d) of the Trademarks Act, 1940 (which is similar in scope as section 14 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) as such it was not registerable and thus a prima facie case is not made out in favour of the appellant, is not sustainable for the reason that section 43 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark the fact that a person is registered as a proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trademark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof, whereas section 44 ibid provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark, the original registration of the trademark shall, after five years from the date of its original registration, be taken to be valid in all respects unless the registration was obtained by fraud or unless it offends the provisions of section 14(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. 
A Court dealing with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. has to consider which of the parties has a prima facie case, balance of convenience or inconvenience and likely to suffer irreparable loss in case of grant or refusal of interim injunction.
The respondent has adopted SHAUKAT and has added the word CRYSTAL before it. Therefore, in essence the question is whether addition of a word to a registered trademark, and in this case which has been used for a long time, makes the two marks sufficiently different based on which there is no possibility of confusion or deception.
","In the circumstances, the impugned order is set-aside and the respondent is restrained from using the word ""SHAUKAT"" as a trademark either alone or along with the word ""CRYSTAL"" or in conjunction with any other word or device along with a wrapper of soap which is yellow and black in colour scheme, design and get up and depicts the portrait of their predecessor in the same place and position as that of the appellant till the decision of the main suit. It is, however, pointed out that no observation made by this Court in this order would be taken into account while deciding the main suit which would be decided on the basis of evidence recorded and the arguments of the parties at the relevant time. The instant appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms.
","During the course of arguments learned counsel for the respondent has failed to answer the query of this Court as to whether or not the claim of the respondent relates to a disputed business built around trademark SHAUKAT SOAP which they were also claiming through common usage or inheritance.
The law provides a proper mechanism and procedure for seeking revocation (section 73) and invalidity of registration (section 80) to an aggrieved party for redressal of its grievance, if it considers that a trademark in dispute was wrongfully registered by its proprietor. No such application/petition appears to have been filed by the respondent before the Court/Forum of Competent Jurisdiction. In the absence of filing of any such formal application, the argument of respondent to that effect cannot be considered. Also unless any act of fraud is prima facie floating on the surface of a trademark registration, the trademark registration, which is obtained after thorough examination and publication of notice in the Trademarks Journal for inviting public objections, must be considered to be validly registered and be enforced to provide certainty to its owner for protection of its registered rights.
The appellant company has exclusive right, reputation and good will therein. Where a party claims registration of a trademark which is valid, this would create a prima facie case in favour of the said party as has been observed in the case of Tabaq v. Tabaq (1987 SCMR 1090) and balance of convenience will also tilt in favour of the appellant/proprietor of the said trademark as infringement of its trademark affects its goodwill and reputation and will be likely to cause said party irreparable loss which cannot be compensated in monetary value. Therefore, the impugned order on this score alone is defective and illegal.
 It clearly provides in section 46(2) that in an action for infringement, all such reliefs by way of damages, injunctions and accounts can be availed by the proprietor of a trademark, and not as alternative to one another. Accordingly, it is apparent that the legislation has intended to clarify that where an injunction, damages and accounts all have been claimed together, an injunction would not be refused just because in addition to an injunction, damages and accounts have also been claimed. This aspect becomes further clear when repealed law namely Trademarks Act, 1940 is reviewed as no similar provisions were available therein, which are now available in the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. 
it appears from the said judgment that the reported cases referred to above namely, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1991 MLD 658, 1993 MLD 590 were neither referred nor considered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in arriving at the decision in the aforesaid case reported as Messrs Super Asia M.D. (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive v. Messrs Anwar Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2007 CLD 1181). Thus in light of the aforesaid cases, and as appellant's trademark SHAUKAT is wholly incorporated in respondent's trademark, the addition of word Crystal is of no consequence and does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion and deception and just because the respondent has added the word Crystal before SHAUKAT does not make respondent's trademark CRYSTAL SHAUKAT sufficiently dissimilar to the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. 
 It is also the case of the appellant that the respondent is trying not only to infringe its trademark but has also adopted a colour scheme of the packaging/wrapper identical to that of the appellant on which the respondent is also using the portrait of a person similar to a portrait of one of the predecessors of the appellant.
In light of the prima facie facts available on record as well as the aforesaid binding judgments of the honourable Supreme Court, and also the judgments of the High Court, it prima facie appears that Respondent has dishonestly adopted the trademark SHAUKAT which is the registered trademark of Appellant. Respondent's addition of the word CRYSTAL before the word SHAUKAT to make it Crystal Shaukat has no bearing or consequences and does not protect it from being liable for infringement of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. This is also as the public might assume that CRYSTAL SHAUKAT is yet another product of the same party which is selling products under the trademark SHAUKAT SOAP or is another quality or range of product and/or manufactured under permission or authorization of the owners of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP, which is being sold in the Pakistani market for decades.","

MUHAMMAD FAHIM---Respondent

","H.C.A. No. 269 of 2014, decided on 3rd May, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Brief facts of the case are that the appellant manufactures and sells syrup under the coined name Rooh Afza for decades and have had the said trademark registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (the 1940 Act) in the British India on 03.08.1942 in class 32. Various versions of the said trademark have been regularly registered by the appellant and from the details provided, we note that about eight registration between years 1961 upto 1984 have been sought by the appellant in respect of the said trademark giving rise to contention that the appellant is very alert in respect of protection and enforcement of its rights in the said trademark. Being a household name used for over a half century, the said trademark has acquired extreme popularity, which also attracts new incumbents to disguise their trademarks and trade-dress similar or confusingly similar to that of the appellant. The appellant's counsel contended that the Appellant became aware of the respondent's intended use of its trademark on 29.06.2014 when the latter advertised its products in the daily Dawn newspaper. Being alerted with the deceptive name and confusing similarities in the label used by the respondent, it was clear that the respondent intended to deceive the customers of the appellant and to take benefit of the hard earned reputation and market space created by the appellant for over 73 years; the appellant commenced legal action which culminated in its filing of the instant suit against the respondent on account of alleged infringement and passing off of appellant's well-known trademark by the respondent. Along with the said suit, the appellant filed an application seeking injunction against the respondent, while an interim injunction was granted to the appellant, however, in terms of the impugned order, the earlier injunction granted was dismissed.
The counsel for the appellant brought to our attention an application moved by the respondent for registration of its trademark filed at the Trademarks Registry bearing No.316901 dated 22.03.2012 in class 30. The learned counsel contended that when advertised, the said application was also opposed by the appellant which opposition bearing No.1662/2013 is still pending adjudication by the Registrar of Trademarks.
From the documents, we of course see that the respondent has also attempted to protect Rooh-e-Samar trademark under the copyright laws by making an application on 10.04.2014, we are not sure about the fate of the said application, however, even if registered that does not give any right to use the said label by the respondent in respect of any goods.
The counsel for the respondent, on the other hand placed heavy reliance on the grounds leveled in the impugned order and tried to take us at microscopic level to show minute difference between the rival marks (e.g. colour of grapes being green in the appellant's mark, while grapes of red colour appear in the respondent's mark) as well as the learned counsel contended that the calligraphy used by the respondent is of different style as compared to that of the appellant. Counsel also contended that while oranges appearing on respondent's wrapper is with skin, the appellant's orange is pealed! While counsel came with many astonishing contentions, one of it included mentioning of Article 18 of the Constitution, which provided for freedom of trade as well as to the novel contention that while customers of appellant's trademark are repeat customers and they purchase the appellant's products by using the brand name Roof Afza, while the respondent being a new entrant in the market, it has only first time buyers who after satisfied with the product place repeat orders. The counsel also stated that since the appellant's trademark is so popular that consumers ask for it by name, no confusion or deception could take place as respondent's trademark has not reached to that level of popularity and it is only purchased as Lal-Shurbat or by its own name Rooh-e-Samar. The counsel loaded us through a series of judgments, where Courts have held the trademark having different suffix and prefix can co-exist. He, inter alia, cited the examples of Coca-cola and Pepsi-cola in support of his client's case, which to us are of no influential value since we are dealing here with a mark that is probably most powerful Pakistani brand with unparalleled repute and domestic heritage and have achieved 6bis well-known trademark's protection under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001.","Courts in a number of cases (2012 CLD 226, 2003 CLD 794, 2000 MLD 2057, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1987 MLD 2569, PLD 1970 Karachi 537, PLD 1969 Karachi 376, PLD 1958 Karachi 481) have discussed methods of finding confusion and deception in relation to rival trade marks primarily relying on the age-old and fundamental 'reaping without sowing' concept evolved in respect of trademarks in the year 1880 pursuant to the House of Lords judgment in the case of Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog (18 CD 396) holding that no man has a right to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader and he cannot, therefore, in the language of Lord Langdale, in the case of Perry v. Truefitt, (6 Beay. 66) be allowed to use names, marks or other indicia, by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person. Over the years some standard tests have been established in this regard. Most famous of these include ""Moron in a Hurry"" and ""Lapp"" tests arising out of Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited (1979 FSR 113) and Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 F.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1983) respectively; and the famous age-old ""Classic Trinity"" test. We will apply all these three tests in the case at hand.
With regards Classic Trinity, courts are required to consider following three aspects of the rival parties:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused (or to be caused) to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.
As one can see, classic trinity test, in a broader way, considers the same factors which the Lapp test does and now when we read all these tests in the light of the 1888 foundation judgment in the Singer case, the moral of all these tests remains the same. No one is allowed to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader by using names, marks or other indicia by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person.","The instant appeal is allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the respondent, its servants, agents, representatives and all persons claiming through it, are restrained from infringing the appellant's registered trademark Rooh Afza and Label in any manner by selling, marketing, offering for sale, advertising or otherwise using on its syrup trade mark Rooh-e-Samar either alone or in conjunction with any other mark, words, figures or devices.
","Beside the above tests, another important aspect that courts need to look at while considering rival trademarks for the possibility of passing test of infringement or passing off is to consider 'get-up' of the rival goods. A Practical Guide to Trade Mark Law by Amanda Michaels (Oxford University Press) defines 'Get-up' as the appearance of a trader's goods which are recognized by the customers. These features of appearance include the size, shape and colour schemes of a product as well as distinctive packaging or the arrangement of labels or the fascia, layout and fitting of a shop. 
Accordingly, get-up is often relied upon by a claimant in addition to the name or the trademark alone. In the instant case also, when we compare get-up of the rival products, we see clear resemblances. These include identical caps, ribs at the bottom of the bottle, word ""ROOH"" as predominant feature of the respondent's label, devices of fruits and the placement of wrapper at the same place as that on the appellant's products. Thus the overall impression left in the mind of an unwary purchaser is nearly the same. One must keep in mind that a person (urban shopper) sees or hears about more than 1500 trade marks in a day (Law for Business by M. M Sulphey and Az-Har Basheer - PHI Learning 2013) and thus not each and every microscopic element of each brand resides in a person's mind. There is a very limited sketch of a brand's get-up that resides in the mind of a purchaser, therefore courts need to come forward and protect that hazy picture developed in the mind of a purchaser by the owner of the original trade mark.
In the light of the foregoing where all three tests produce results favouring the appellant, we are of the view that use of the intended trademark, trade dress and get-up by the respondent infringes common-law right of the Appellants as well as their statutory rights provided pursuant to its registration and continuous use of its Rooh Afza trademark and trade-dress.","

","High Court Appeal No. 244 of 2014, decided on 18th March, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Being aggrieved by the order dated 16 September, 2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.752 of 2014, disposing of the injunction application in favour of the present Respondent and restraining the Appellant from using the trade mark ""Shield and Device of Shield"", holding it identical and deceptively similar with the trade mark ""Health Shield plus Device of Shield"" of the Plaintiff, the instant appeal has been filed.
While the learned Single Judge has dealt the matter at length in the impugned order, snapshot of the controversy is that the Respondent who is a leading national entity engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling goods related to toothpaste, toothbrushes and baby care products since 1974 and, as claimed by his counsel and as per the copies of numerous trade mark registration certificates attached along with his counter, has obtained registration of the said trade mark, which acts as a house mark, in respect of all goods/services falling in Class-1 to Class 45 of the International Classification of Goods and Services under the Nice agreement (applicable in Pakistan also), notwithstanding that the business of the Respondent doesn't fall in more than a few classes of goods, in particular, class 3 for toothpaste, class 21 for toothbrushes, and class 10 for baby feeders and alike baby products.
On the other hand, the Appellant is a manufacturer and one of the most renowned vegetable ghee and cooking oil brand in the country taking the inception from pre-partition days and enjoys immense household reputation in relation to their goods i.e. Banaspati Ghee and Vegetable Oils, falling in Class 29.","To us, beside what has been settled in the above paragraph, the present controversy revolves around two basic elements:
(i) A trader while in the business of selected range of goods registers his trade mark in respect of all or a large number of classes of goods/services and uses the said instrument of registration certificate to restrain other traders from using a portion of his trade mark in respect of goods which the former has never manufactured and seeks to restrain the latter from using the portion of his trade mark in relation to goods which are of prime commercial interest to the latter; and
(ii) In what circumstances a trade mark can be held to be confusedly similar with another trade mark?
The answer to the second point is buried in piles of cases dating back centuries where courts have established the test of comparing two trade marks. These tests have been over and over used in numerous cases including those decided by courts in Pakistan. Briefly speaking the courts have come to the conclusion that while comparing as to deceptive similarity of two trade mark, the test known as Classic Trinity requires courts to consider following three aspects:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.","Thus, in the instant case, on account of the foregoing considerations, we come to the conclusion that the allegations of the Respondent are completely flawed on all the above discussed accounts, and the Appellant has legit reasons to continue to use its impugned trade mark. These are the reasons for the short order passed on 24.02.2016 allowing this appeal and dismissing the injunction application filed in the Suit No. 752/2014.","In order to give a face to the controversy, we find it prudent to reproduce the two contesting trade marks in the following:
Appellant's Trade Mark Respondent's Trade Mark
Also of relevance, is the manner in which these trade marks are used on their respective products; which we reproduce as under:
Appellant's Product Sample Respondent's Product Sample
There is a difference between the use of a mark (or sign) ordinarily and use of a mark as a trade mark. While a mark could be any graphical representation of a visually perceivable item on the packaging of a product (in the instant case), and the consumer connects it with the source of the goods. In other words when a mark (or sign) is used as a trade mark, it starts connecting products (or services) to their respective sources and origins and the customer uses the said mark when choosing a particular product, or when refusing another product instead. The manufacturer of Dalda cooking oil decides to remove the said Health Shield sign from its packaging, it will not affect distinctiveness of trade mark Dalda and the customer will always reach out and choose Dalda as their choice of product, in this example. This is the key difference between a mark (or sign) and a trade mark.
In the instant case, it is admitted that the Respondent has reputation and goodwill in its trade mark, however, such reputation and goodwill is only limited to the goods falling in Classes 3, 21 and 10, being toothbrushes, toothpastes, baby feeders and allied baby products. With regards, part 2, ""misrepresentation"" made by the Appellant, it can also be seen by looking at the complete packaging of the Appellant's product (as reproduced in paragraph 5), that no attempt has been made by the Appellant to misrepresent or disguise itself as the Respondent or to sail close to the Respondent. Applying the ""Moron In A Hurry"" test in the instant case, we tend to agree that even a moron in a hurry will not pick a bottle of Dalda cooking oil instead of Shield toothpaste, even if his last train is leaving for home in the next 5 minutes, on a Friday night.
With regards the third part of classic trinity, there is no iota in our mind that when products of both the parties are so different in nature, sold to different customer-needs, kept at different locations in shops (usually); a case of actual damage or loss to the Respondent on account of Appellant's use of the impugned trade mark could be imagined even. Therefore without taking any further time, we can safely conclude that the classic trinity test passes in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondent.
a trade mark is a badge of origin, the grant of a registration certificate is made to the person who uses (or honestly proposes to use) a trade mark in the course of trade to the benefit of customers so that the customers can distinguish the said trader's goods apart from other competitors' products. A trade mark registration certificate is thus a seal imposed by the Government certifying that goods manufactured (or sold) under the said trade mark will only and legitimately be sourced by the person in whose name the trade mark is registered. The concept of purity of trade mark register hinges to the idea that trade marks which are not used by their respective owners, shall be removed from the register of trade marks since possession of the registration certificate without active commercial use of the trade mark negates the very purpose of trade mark legislation.
By stretching beyond the umbrella provided, the legislation intends to mean that the person who has registered a trade mark is threatening infringement thereof when the defendant is (a) not using the identical trade mark; or (b) not in the course of trade; and (c) not using the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services. It could be thus seen that the act of the Appellant does not come anywhere inside the triangle created by these three pillars, therefore no infringement of the registered trade mark of the Respondent has been established.
As a last round, the counsel for the Respondent contended the act of the Appellant is causing ""dilution"" of the Respondent's trade mark. While, at the first hand, since the mark of the Respondent is allegedly registered in class 29, therefore a better claim (as already raised by it) ought to be of infringement, rather than of dilution. While there is no global list of well-known trade marks, but Coca-Cola; Google; Apple; McDonalds; Microsoft; IBM; Citibank; Boeing; Toyota are said to qualify such a list. With regards national trade marks, without prejudice, we are of the opinion, and such list could include trade marks like Mobilink, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, which on the basis of their immense reputation and goodwill, could be protected from unauthorized use on non-competing goods and services. Therefore to allege the 'dilution' claim, the Respondent has to prove the highest degree of fame required under section 86, to which in our opinion, trade mark of the Respondent SHIELD does not rise.

","Suit No.2595 of 2014, decided on 19th November, 2015.",,,"Learned counsel for plaintiff contends that plaintiff is having registered trade mark of POWER SONIC in the name of Javed Akhter Chauhan Trading as ""Javedan Resources Corporation"" since then plaintiff is carrying business, under that title whereas defendants have no right to continue their business on the same trade mark, such trade mark is only registered in the name of the plaintiff. Albeit, defendant No.3 is claiming the same trade mark as registered in USA but such certificate is not appended with the written statement or the counter affidavit. He contends that there is no issue of authorization of agency but in instant suit issue of trade mark is involved. He also refers section 73, subsection (3) of sections 80, 86 and 96 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. It is also contended that defendants 2 and 3 have not sought permission to run their business in Pakistan hence their application is without any substance and grounds taken in their application, are not falling within the parameters of section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. He relied upon PLD 2000 Karachi 139, 2007 CLC 1610 and 2003 PLC 26.
In contra, learned counsel for defendants Nos.2 and 3 contends that plaintiff was agent of defendants Nos.2 and 3 up-to 2009/2010 and thereafter on same trade mark he got registration in Pakistan hence under Paris Convention of Intellectual Property, 1833 rights of the defendants are protected; while referring emails and documents submitted with counter affidavit emphasis that plaintiff was their agent and continuously remained in contact with defendants with regard to such business.","Since name and style of trade mark is not disputed but question, before this Court as raised by respective parties, appears to be confined to the extent of registration of same trade mark in Pakistan in favour of plaintiff with reference to 'Paris convention' and applicability thereof within object of Chapter-X of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. A proper respond to the issue, would require a reference to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of the plaint which are as under:-
That defendant No.3 is a company carrying on business at California, U.S.A. It gets the batteries and battery cells manufactured from the Peoples Republic of China & Vietnam and import them to the U.S.A. The batteries and battery cells are labeled under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label and thereafter they are shipped to Pakistan. The goods were also shipped from Republic of China & Vietnam to Pakistan. The plaintiff was carrying on business with it and was their representative in Pakistan until the year 2009-2010.
That thereafter the relations between them became strained and the defendant No.3 started exporting its goods to defendants Nos. 1 and 2 under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label.
That the marks POWER SONIC Label of the plaintiff and POWER SONIC Label of the defendants are identical with each other, visually as well as phonetically. Besides this, the design, get up and colour scheme of both the marks are identical, thus causing confusion and deception during the course of trade.
From bare reading of the above paragraphs of the pleadings of the plaintiff himself (itself) following facts are prima facie admitted i.e.:
i) defendant No.3 continuously has been exporting its product under marks 'POWER SONIC' from California etc.;
ii) plaintiff has been in active knowledge and notice that defendant No.1 is carrying its business under such mark;
iii) plaintiff has been selling product of the defendant No.1 as 'agent' of defendant No.3;
iv) mark of plaintiff, though got registered, is identical to that of defendant No.3 with each other visually as well as phonetically;","It is quite safe to say that no prima facie case or balance of convenience is available to the plaintiff, rather application, so filed by the plaintiff, is devoid of substance which accordingly is dismissed. On the other hand since, the mark of the defendant No.3 is 'well known mark in Pakistan', and is protected by Chapter-X of the Ordinance hence application of the defendant No.3 is allowed which otherwise is within scope and object of section 86(3). However, plaintiff is at liberty to approach Registrar for fresh registration of its independent mark.
","It is safe to say that it is not disputed that plaintiff was agent of defendants with regard to same business and even under the trade mark ""Power Sonic"" labels he was carrying out by receiving shipments. Now, to examine the applicability of Chapter-X of the Ordinance would require reference to sections 85, 86 and 92 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The owner of a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention as a well-known trade mark shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Pakistan of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical or deceptively similar to the well-known trade mark-
(a) in relation to identical or similar goods or services, where the use is likely to cause confusion; or
(b) where such use causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the well-know trade mark.
(4) Rights conferred under subsection (3) shall be subject to the provisions of section 81 and nothing in the said subsection shall effect the continuation of any bona fide use of a trade mark begun before the commencement of this Ordinance.
Trade name.---A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not.
Perusal of section 85 categorical suggests that Pakistan is the signatory of Paris Convention and is a Convention country. Definition of ""Paris Convention"" means that ""Paris convention for the protection of industrial property of the 20th March, 1833"". The 'Paris convention' was also a step to ensure protection to 'well-known marks' in all signatory countries even if they (trade-marks) are not literally registered in all countries. The inclusion of Chapter-X in the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is itself an admission to vitality of such aspect particularly when it assures protection but to 'well known marks'. At this juncture, I would insist that the bare reading of the section 86(1)(b), in existence of admitted positions, is sufficient to bring the mark of the defendant No.3 as 'well known in Pakistan'. Once it is prima facie established that a 'mark' is qualifying the meaning of 'well-known in Pakistan' it shall be entitled to all protections 'available to such 'mark'. Since name and style is not disputed and question of registration is categorically defined in section 92 with regard to trade name, which provides that ""A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not."" I am equally conscious with object of the Section 90 of the Ordinance but such plea is not taken by the plaintiff that plaintiff got the registration of mark of defendant No.3 in his (plaintiff's) favour within notice and knowledge of the defendant No.3 or that defendant No.3 has acquiesced such registration of its 'mark' in favour of the plaintiff. On the other hand, the plaintiff himself admitted that on becoming relations strained between plaintiff and defendant No.3, the defendant No.3 started shipping its product to defendants Nos.1 and 2. Needless to add that even while resorting to procedure of section 90, the plaintiff was legally required to have made this fact clear within notice and knowledge of the 'Registrar' so as to allow an opportunity of hearing to defendant No.3 to oppose such registration of its mark because the provision of section 90(a) leaves the Registrar with no discretion to register such 'mark' where proprietor opposes such registration. The admission of plaintiff that defendant No.3 has been continuing its business under same mark is sufficient to indicate its intention to enjoy privileges, available to such mark, under Convention of 1833. At this moment, it would be noteworthy to add here that if such practice is allowed then in every country any agent or other person would start that practice by getting registration from that area by taking the benefits of goodwill attached with such well-known mark. If so, it would mean nothing but a negation of the Convention which otherwise provides protection to the creator and such scheme as enshrined is to save the rights of intellectual property. Not only this but such agent shall become entitled to the fruits of the name and good-will attached with such 'mark' which cannot be allowed to happen because the name and good-will are not earned/established over-nights by mere preparing a product alone but the efforts and finance which make that 'mark' to stand in the market with its own name.",MH/J-16/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","
Suit No. 516 of 2015, heard on 22nd April, 2016.",,,"Brief facts of the plaintiff's case as contended are that they are insurance company incorporated on 29.6.1995 and was renamed as New Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited in October 2004. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in order to distinguish its high quality insurance services from other insurance companies they have adopted and coined number of distinctive service marks including the service mark ""Amaan Plan"" which are protected under the trademark laws in Pakistan. Such mark was registered on 24.7.2014 having registration No. 338428 in class 36 for the services which include insurance, financial affairs, monetary affairs and real estate affairs. It is contended that such service mark was adopted in the year 2007 for the insurance policies which were issued to different individuals which are available as annexure-G onwards. It is contended that with the passage of time such service mark has gained popularity and the number of policies were issued since 2007 and business gained momentum since then.
Learned Counsel submitted that by virtue of continuous and extensive use the service mark has earned reputation and goodwill. He contended that by virtue of prior adoption and continuous use of the mark since 2007 the plaintiff has presented himself as bona fide proprietor and owner of the service mark. It is argued that for the first time in September 2014 it came in the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendant started insurance policies under the plaintiff's registration mark ""Amaan Plan"" hence formal letter was issued to them which was replied and they were subsequently informed that they have obtained registration of the trademark ""Amaan Plan"" in the form of logo. Learned Counsel submits that despite the notice/letters the defendant did not stop the infringement of the plaintiff's registration and hence they have issued a legal notice. It is argued that the impugned mark is deceptively similar which is likely to mislead and cause confusion to the innocent customers and general public. Thus learned Counsel submitted that the defendant be restrained from using plaintiff's registered service mark ""Amaan Plan"" or ""Amaan"" and sought declaration that the service mark ""Amaan"" alone is deceptively similar and amounts to infringement of plaintiff's registered service mark.
The defendants have filed their respective replies.  Learned counsel has taken me to a letter issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan wherein the SECP has allowed them to transact Classes of window takaful business as specified. Learned Counsel has taken me to the definition of ""insurance"" and ""takaful"" and urged that there is huge difference between two services and hence there could not be a confusion in the minds of the customers since two products are different. Learned Counsel submitted that the plaintiff deals in the life insurance policies whereas the takaful is not at all meant for life insurance. Learned Counsel has relied upon the definition of conventional insurance business as provided under sub-Rule (iv) of Rule 2 of the Takaful Rules, 2012. Learned Counsel has added that they deal in all kinds of takaful other than life insurance such as fire takaful, marine takaful, motor takaful, engineering takaful and miscellaneous takaful and none of the above is a conventional insurance either life or non-life and hence they are neither identical nor similar services as compared to the plaintiffs' service ""Amaan Plan"" and the question of infringement does not arise.",At the very outset the counsel for the defendant does not object to the similarity of the mark and the only reason assigned to the use of such .registered trademark is that the services provided by the plaintiff is dissimilar to the services in question trademark provided by the defendant.,"In my view the defendants have failed to justify bona fide adoption of the word, ""Amaan Plan"" and/or ""Amaan"" as they may have other choices instead of plaintiff's registered mark which has already gained popularity and enjoying a goodwill in the market, hence I am of the view that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, balance of inconvenience is also in their favour and they would suffer irreparable loss unless the application is allowed as prayed. Accordingly the application is allowed.
","It is the case of the defendant that they are dealing with takaful whereas the plaintiff's service is limited to the extent of life insurance policies and hence the two customers are not common. The definition of ""similar services"" provided under the trademark laws are of importance while deciding the question under reference. Section 2 subsection (xlv) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides definition of ""similar service"" which reads as under:-
""S.40(xlv): ""Similar services"" included services which are of the same description;

Section 39 of the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 relates to the rights conferred by registration whereas section 40 of the Ordinance deals, with the infringement of the registered trademark. In terms of section 40 subsection 3(c) of the Ordinance a person shall infringe a registered trademark if the person uses in the course of a trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trademark in relation to services of the same description as that of service in respect of which a trademark is registered. The proposition thus appears to be simple that service which is being dealt with by both the plaintiff and the defendant whether is of same description or otherwise to attract the provisions as referred above. I may refer to the international classification of goods and services and it seems that it is being dealt with by class-36 and there is no dispute in this regard as the defendant himself chooses to apply under the same class. The defence that they have been dealing with takaful business would not turn much as it is being dealt with by the same classification. Where may not be any doubt that the takaful business may not be of conventional insurance but the question arises as to why a proprietary right for a registered mark could be allowed to infringe by the defendant who provide services of the same class i.e. class 36 which may, cause confusion in the mind of the customers. Another answer to a question that the plaintiff is dealing with life insurance policies whereas defendant is not, the word ""Amaan Plan"" of the plaintiff has gained so much popularity that the customers who may wish to have other policies of the plaintiff could be deceived by the mark of the defendant as they would presume that the plaintiff has also started dealing with other kinds of policies. The provisions of section 40 of, the Ordinance are thus clear insofar as the entitlement of the plaintiff is concerned. The defendant has not shown any reason plausible at law as to why they have chosen an invented word of the plaintiff which has gained popularity since 2007 which is not denied by the defendant. Considering the background of the plaintiff's business, it seems that the adoption of the same trademark which is phonetically and visually similar and there is likelihood that it would create confusion and deception to the Customers of such class. There is no specific provision available in the Trademark Ordinance for the registration of service mark as takaful service. The license obtained from SECP for takaful service does not meant for the infringement of the plaintiff's registered mark nor does it allow the defendant to act in such manner.",SL/J-12/Sindh Application allowed.,Allowed.

In continuation of the said line of business, the appellants, sometime in 1973, allegedly made certain important innovations in the manner of toothpaste being extruded from the mouth of a toothpaste tube onto a toothbrush, which primarily included multi-colour toothpaste. emanating from the toothpaste tubes, which typically were used only to release toothpaste in one colour (hereinafter referred to as ""speckled toothpaste slug device""), commonly known as 'slugs'. the appellants confess that speckled toothpaste containing granules of same and different colour emanating from toothpaste slug have been manufactured and marketed throughout the world by various companies including the appellants, and on their account, the speckled toothpaste slug device being used by different manufactures, cannot be held to be distinctive to any particular manufacturer and no person should be allowed to acquire monopoly or exclusive right for the use of the speckle toothpaste slug device in any manner. When such applications of the Respondent No.2 were advertised in the Trade Marks Journal, the appellants opposed grant of said applications, which oppositions were rejected by the impugned order, wherein the learned Registrar held in paragraph 31 as under:
 ""It would be just and equitable to grant right to the applicants in respect of the marks only for the applied colours and the toothpaste is no doubt descriptive and non-distinctive, however, as stated earlier that the colours combinations make them distinctive and as such the proprietors thereof should be given rights to the extent of colours for which the marks are applied for and the formation for which they have worked out. In view of the above I hereby dispose of the oppositions as under.""
After refusing the oppositions filed by the appellants, the Registrar allowed applications of the Respondent No.2, however, with certain limitation of colours, meaning thereby that Respondent No.2 though could have no monopoly in slug device per se, however, if the slug device comprises of the colours for which the registration has been obtained by the Respondent No.2, no person should be allowed to get such colour combination of slug devices. Since the instant contention of the Registrar was contrary to the assertions of the appellants that identical slug devices are being deployed by a number of manufacturers, and have thus became common to trade, no registration thereof ought to have been granted to any person. ","Global definition of a trade mark whether it is under section 2(1)(1) of the 1940 Act or under section 68(1) of the UK 1938 Act lives within the following four corners of ""a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate, a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right . . . to use the mark, whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person . . ."". This definition got more liberal under post-WTO regime, and the new set of TRIPs-complaint laws define a trade mark to mean (e.g. section 2(1)xlvii of the Pakistan Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) any mark capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. Both these definitions have a common denominator, i.e., commerce. Marks have to be put to commercial use, i.e., put in the course of trade.
When these slug devices which are pictorial representations of the goods itself, were put up for registration as a trade mark, trade mark experts asked a question. Could a picture of the good (i.e. toothpaste) itself be said as use of the good in the course of trade? Since no one would be able to see the toothpaste until he purchases it, takes it home and squeezed it! As the very function of a trade mark is to depict connectivity of the product with its provider, such badge of origin has to be obvious to a purchaser so that he can put his hands on the desirable product. Once a product is purchased, the consumer has already married to the product and any further attributes attached to the product become of secondary value as the transaction has already been consummated, therefore what comes out from the open end of a toothpaste once a person squeezes it is a post-purchase experience and the invisible stripes are of no trade mark value as they are also devoid of any distinctive character, which is a prerequisite for a trade mark to be registered.","For the various reasons cited hereinabove, I am of the view that the marks consisting of slug devices (being combinations of stripes, speckles and colors - while seen as the arrangement of the product itself, or mere decoration, or even as indicating any ingredients in the toothpaste), fail to distinguish the applicant's goods and therefore do not function as a trade mark and are thus debarred from registration.
For the above reasons, the instant appeals are allowed and the impugned order is set aside.
Office is directed to make a copy of this judgment and place the same in each of the MA files, and send a copy of this judgment to the Registrar of Trade Marks, for publication in the electronic version of the forthcoming Trade Marks Journal.","Section 6(e) of the 1940 Act essentially requires distinctiveness in the mark in order for granting registration to the mark. Trade marks devoid of any distinctive character are not accorded any place on the register. Test for finding distinctive character was summarized in the Henkel's Application, SRIS O/152/01, as well as, in the case of Yakult Honsha KK's Trade Mark Application reported as 2001 RPC 756 where Justice Laddie held that ""the fact that a particular design is eye-catching because it is unusual or decorative is not enough by itself. At all times the Registry has to ask whether the design is distinctive as a badge of origin ...... the fact that a container is unusual or attractive does not, per se, mean that it will be taken by the public as an indication of origin. The relevant question is not whether the container would be recognised on being seen a second time, that is to say, whether it is of memorable appearance, but whether by itself its appearance would convey trade mark significance to the average customer. For the purpose of this appeal, I am prepared to accept that the bottle shape is both new and visually distinctive, meaning that it would be recognised as different to other bottles on the market. That does not mean that it is inherently distinctive in a trade mark sense."" One can easily gather from the above guidance that for a mark to have a distinctive character, a customer, when looking at the product on a second time, should be able to connect the product to his past experiences with the instant product, which means, notwithstanding the eye-catching nature of the design, the product has to be re-recognised on being seen on the second time. It is not very hard to deduce from the above that the visual or sensual contact with the product is very critical for a purchaser to distinctively remember it and recall images of the identical product purchased by him in the past. 
For similar slug devices trade marks filed in the UK, the applications were refused by the Comptroller General with the following observations:
""In my view the sign applied for will not be taken as a trade mark without first educating the public that it is a trade mark. It follows that this application is debarred from prima facie acceptance by Section 3(1)(b) of the Act.""
The Swiss Supreme Court also in 2005 upheld a decision not to register the shape of a slug of toothpaste as a trade mark.
Before I proceed towards conclusion, I find it relevant to mention the case of ""Intel Inside"", which (one could say) has somewhat relevancy with the instant scenario where the discussion is held about trade mark applied to goods which are not visible to the customer. Intel Corporation is one of the leading manufacturer of integrated circuits and microprocessors. Intel realized that since its trade mark hidden from the eyes of the purchaser directly, it should arrange to put ""Intel Inside"" on the packaging of the products wherein Intel microprocessors were used, to covey to the public that the products they are intending to purchase, use Intel's microprocessors.
As mentioned in the foregoing, even though (by and large) end consumers do not themselves buy Intel products as such, the company's success in persuading computer manufacturers to use the ""Intel Inside"" mark on the exterior body of the computers contributed to the huge reputation of the said trade mark resulting that anyone who sees the said mark used in relation to computers or computer-linked products or services takes it as denoting a trade connection with appellant. To the contrary, the case in hand is about natural outflow of toothpaste mass from the tube as the tube is squeezed, and the nature and color of the slug device emanating from the tube, in my view, do not make any trade connection with the manufacturer of the toothpaste, thus such devices could not be held as trade marks, or to have any secondary meaning.","

Mrs. QURAT-UL-AIN MANSOOR and others---Respondents
 

","H.C.As. Nos.151, 152 and 153 of 2015, decided on 10th February, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","The appellant, a partnership firm established in the year 2002 for providing beauty salon and parlor services in Karachi claims to have commenced its business since its inception under the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"". On the other hand, the respondent claims to have set up beauty salon and parlor in Lahore as early as 1990 and contends that the appellant was her employee when Alle'nora commenced its branch operations in Karachi in 2002. The dispute between the parties is in relation to trade mark and trade name (hereinafter referred to as trade mark) ""ALLE'NORA"" used by them which has resulted in three suits and counter suits agitated by one against the other. The above referred impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge was passed accordingly in respect of all three suits heard together adjudicating claim as to the ownership of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark between the said two contestants. An analytical look at the impugned judgment depicts that the learned Single Judge has very carefully crafted three important issues, being (i) which of the parties is a prior user of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Pakistan; (ii) has any of the parties a right to the exclusive use of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" anywhere in Pakistan; and (iii) is the prior user so determined is entitled to the relief claimed in their respective suits?
 The admitted facts are that the respondent has established that it has a prior use commencing from the year 1990 in Lahore in respect of the above referred trade mark, as well as, it has also registered the said trade mark with the Trade Mark Registry, Government of Pakistan in Class 44 effective from 29.07.2006. On the other hand, the appellant as stated to in the foregoing, upon creation of its partnership in 2002 admits to have commenced use of trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Karachi and has filed an application for registration of trade mark on 14.11.2006 and an application for registration of copyright with the Pakistan Copyright Registry on the same date, which applications are pending. It cannot be ignored that in both the said applications, the applicants has claimed use of the said trade mark since 2002 only.
","While we observe that the order of the learned Single Judge has very aptly addressed to the various issues raised by the counsel of the appellant, however, the following two contentions of the counsel crave for further deliberations:
 (a) The ingredients and test required to establish honest and concurrent use of trade marks; and
 (b) The defense of geographical distances while using another trader's trade mark.
","We, therefore, do not find any force in the assertion either that someone else's trade mark could be used in another part of the country just because the original trader had decided not to open the branch or put his presence in other part of the country or the goods carrying with trade mark are not made available to some other parts within the country. These appeals thus have no merit.
These are the reasons of short order passed in Court on 10.02.2016 dismissing the above referred appeals.","With regard to the first issue, the learned counsel relied on the above referred 1947 judgment, which has been distinguished by us as to its limitation towards latter's applicability in the instant case. Thus the above citation does not satisfy us. It is an established global understanding that the key concept behind trade mark jurisdiction revolves around protection against confusion, deception and fraud. The very purpose an honest trader choses a distinctive or novel trade mark is to keep his goods or service distant from the possibility of being taken as a competitor's goods or services. The very reasons for the creation of an intellectual property legal system is to provide for a mechanism for the protection and offering rewards to creativity and fair trade. 
In the instant case, the trade mark in question is ""ALLE'NORA"", which admittedly was first used by the respondent in Lahore as early as 1990, and was used by the appellant, who admittedly commenced their business in Karachi in the year 2002. One can easily understand that in the year 2002 when the appellant commenced their business in Karachi, they had on their drawing board (or computer screens) a copy of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark used by the respondent in Lahore. The appellant decided to select the said trade mark of the respondent in identical type-font, colors and calligraphy with the sole objective to get benefit from the existence of the respondent's earlier trade mark existing in the market place and to reap benefits from the well-earned reputation of the said trade mark. When the counsel for the appellant was asked to satisfy this Court as to why each and every essential element of the respondent's trade mark is present in the trade mark used or proposed to be used by the appellant, the learned counsel had no answer except to say it is purely by co-incidence, he, however tried to defend his case by alleging that even if the appellant has used each and every essential feature, font, colour and style of the respondent's trade mark, but his client has put her name (Aliya Tipu) in the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" to distinguish her business apart from the possibility of creation of any confusion between the ""ALLE'NORA"" of Lahore and ""ALLE'NORA"" of Karachi. The Court reverted holding that the very fact that a trader uses a prominent or substantial part of some body's else trade mark with a prefix, suffix or with any other element along with the earlier trade mark, all he is doing is to admit to the existence of the prior trade mark, and trying to come under the umbrella of the earlier trade mark attempting to fool the general public that his goods and services are as good as these provided by the owner of the earlier trade mark, but he is not the original person. 
In today's world, reputation and goodwill of a trade spreads at the speed of light. The goodwill acquired by the respondent in Lahore is not necessarily limited to that city where the services were available. The admitted fact is that these services were duly advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and internet having circulation to all over the country, and even abroad. It is also an established view in trade mark jurisdiction that goodwill or reputation does not depend upon the availability of goods/services any more. We would even come to the extent to say that even if a manufacturer or service provider suspends his business activity in a particular part of the country, the cloud of the reputation and goodwill stays there even afterwards, unless it is washed away by the winds of change. The Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is based on equitable principles wherein if a person by hard work had established a goodwill or reputation in one part of the country, the law in terms of Section 1(2) protects such reputation and goodwill throughout Pakistan. The relevant territory under the said Ordinance is the whole of Pakistan and that the relevant public consisted of both the general public and interested customers across the country.
 Notwithstanding a registered trade mark, even in cases where the trade mark is not registered, reputation and goodwill in a trade mark can be protected, pursuant to the procedure laid down in the said Ordinance by granting an option of filing a passing off action. For this reason, the legal system is built upon protecting the hard work, ingenuity and goodwill of a person who is first one to use a trade mark, trade name or any other similar source identifier (including domain name, etc.) from the attacks made by competitors. The established legal principle that whenever rights in a trade mark (whether registered or not), are attacked, the wheel of the legal system will spin in the direction of protecting the honest and first adopter in order to safeguard his hard earned reputation and as well as to save customers from such disguise.
 In this regard, the age-old principles set by the apex Court formulated in Tabaq Restaurant (Lahore) v. Tabaq Restaurant (Rawalpindi) in 1987 SCMR 1090 are beacon of guidance. The dispute, as the titles suggests, was in relation to use of Tabaq trade mark in Lahore of any earlier date, which was adopted by a competing restaurant in Rawalpindi. The apex Court laid down the principle that notwithstanding the geographical distances, a trade mark owner receives protection against use of his mark by another in such a away as is likely to lead consumers to associate the other's goods with the trade mark owner.

HILAL FOODS (PVT.) LTD. through Company Secretary---Respondent
 

","High Court Appeal No. 55 of 2015, decided on 12th December, 2015.",,,"Briefly stated, facts of the case are that the respondent/plaintiff filed a Suit being No. 1140 of 2014 against the appellant/defendant for permanent injunction, damages and rendition of accounts for infringement, passing off and unfair competition under Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (the ""Ordinance, 2001""). The respondent/plaintiff is a private limited company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984, earlier named Hilal Confectionary and now known as Hilal Foods (""Hilal""). The person through and under whom the appellant/defendant claims, an Indian company by name Dabur India Ltd. (""Dabur"") are already in litigation in this Court under Suit No. 14 of 1995, filed by Dabur against Hilal for passing off, which is still pending adjudication. In that suit, Dabur sought interim relief, which was granted as prayed by a learned Single Judge, vide order dated 21.5.1999. Against that order, Hilal preferred High Court Appeal No. 275 of 1999, which is also pending adjudication. On 11.04.2000 the appeal was admitted to regular hearing and the order made by the learned Single Judge was modified to a certain extent. The trademark over which Hilal and Dabur are in dispute is ""Hajmola"". The goods, which each claims it has the right to sell under the trademark fall in classes 5 and 30 of the international classification of goods. Hilal; however, claims that it is the owner by way of an assignment registered on 30.11.1995 from the proprietor (M/s. Khamisani Sons Agencies Supplies) of ""Hajmola"" as a registered trademark in class 5, being registration No. 78160, under goods description ""Unani Medicines"". This registration is as of 4.11.1982. Dabur has challenged this registration in J.M No. 58/1997, which is also still pending adjudication.
 The respondent/plaintiff also moved an application in the afore mentioned suit being C.M.A. No.9196/2014 seeking interim injunctive relief by restraining the appellant/defendants, their agent, etc. from infringing and/or from passing off and/or from unfair competition by using/manufacturing/distribution/ marketing/sale or offering for sale their goods by using the imitated trademark ""Hajmola"" and from any other trademark deceptively similar and/or having near resemblance to that of the respondent/plaintiff in any manner whatsoever till disposal of the suit. The learned Single Judge vide order dated 21.1.2015 allowed the said C.M.A. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant/defendant has preferred this High Court Appeal.
",nil,"For the foregoing facts and reasons, we do not find any merit in the instant Intra High Appeal; therefore, the same dismissed, along with pending application, with no order as to costs. However, the appellant shall be free to move an application before the learned Single Judge to establish that it has acquired the right from Dabur India to sell or manufacture its products in Pakistan.

Above are the reasons of our short order dated 14.04.2015 by which we had dismissed this High Court Appeal.","The only material in this regard that is available on the record is a letter dated 08.08.2012, titled as Letter of Confirmation/Letter of Authorization, signed by Mr. Dinesh Shah, who is described as Dabur's ""Head-Legal"" and ""Authorized Signatory"", on behalf of Dabur India Ltd., under Board of Directors Resolution dated 31.01.2012, the copy thereof also annexed thereto. We have cautiously examined the said letter. Its relevant para No. 11 and resolution read, as under:
Letter
By virtue of the authority granted, Dabur International Limited has licensed Asian Consumer Care to do the following acts and deeds on behalf of Dabur in Pakistan:
a. To enter into, make, execute all agreements, with any manufacturer(s) for manufacturing of our products under the trademark Hajmola, i.e. Hajmola Candy in different flavours and/or with different words together with the word ""Hajmola"";
b. To import and keep the raw materials required for manufacturing of the product under the trademark Hajmola i.e. Hajmola Candy in different flavours and/or with different words together with the word ""Hajmola"" candy, in its custody and supply to the manufacturer(s) according to the agreement;
c. To import, market/sell products of Dabur bearing the trademark Hajmola; and
d. To appoint distributors/wholesalers/retailers to sell the products under the trademark Hajmola and enter into agreements with them.
The certified true copy of the resolution may be issued under the signatures of any one of Mr. Ashok Kr Jain, Sr. General Manager-Finance and Company Secretary, Mr. Parveen Mudgal, Jt. Company Secretary and Mrs. Sarita Agarwal, Manager-Secretarial.""
It may be observed, from a plain reading of the afore-mentioned resolution, that it authorizes various persons to do various acts, essentially of a legal nature or relating to such affairs, including the authority to represent Dabur in all proceedings before the courts. But by no stretch of imagination it authorizes any of the authorized persons to delegate such authority to appellant as enunciated in para 11 of the letter of authorization. The contents of a resolution of a company are strictly construed and no power or authorization should be made into the same which is not expressly set out therein as articulated by the maxim ""Potestas stricte interpretatur"" (A power should be strictly interpreted). Therefore, Mr. Dinesh Shah, the Head-Legal of Dabur cannot delegate the authority to appellant that has not been delegated to him by the Dabur. It is therefore, the learned Single Judge of this Court, in our view, has rightly held the said letter in the impugned order as merely a descriptive letter, which does not even give any dates as to when the relevant relationship/arrangement came into existence between the appellant and Dabur, which is simply not enough to consider the former as sub-licensee of the latter. As such the appellant cannot be termed as an ""Authorized user"" for the use of trade mark ""Hajmola"" as ""permitted use"" as defined in Section 2(iii) and (xxxi) of the Ordinance, 2001. Respondent, thus, prima facie has succeeded to establish its case for the purpose of interim injunctive relief.",MH/A-107/Sindh Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

Messrs A. RAHIM FOODS (PRIVATE) LIMITED FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES: In the matter of

 
","Show Cause Notice No. 1 dated 3rd April, 2014, decided on 8th February, 2016.",,,"The Complainant is engaged in the poultry business, and also in the processing, marketing and sales of frozen and processed meat products. The Respondent is a part of the Dawn Foods group of companies, (the 'Dawn Group'), and is engaged in the business of manufacturing, processing, marketing and sales of a large variety of food and frozen food products.
The Complainant alleged that the Respondent had copied its distinctive and instantly identifiable labelling and packaging which it developed for its frozen and/or processed meat products, thereby causing deception which has the effect of misleading and confusing consumers, while taking undue advantage of the market standing and goodwill of its products.
With regard to the above, a formal enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 12 December 2013, (the 'Enquiry Report')1. Based on the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report, a SCN was issued to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before the Commission. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 4.23 in particular, it appears that:
(a) By using the exact language, font and color scheme of the Complainant's packaging material of frozen, processed, ready to cook and fully cooked chicken and meat products on its own frozen food product's packaging by the Undertaking is misleading and deceptive and is prima facie violation of the provisions of section 10 of the Act, in particular section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
(b) The use of mark 'COMBO WINGS"" by the Undertaking without seeking authorization from the Complainant being a trademark owner, is misleading, deceptive and fraudulent and in prima facie violation of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act, in particular, section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
(c) The use of exact language, font and color scheme of the Complainant's packaging material of frozen, processed, ready to cook and fully cooked chicken and meat products on its own frozen food product's packaging and the use of mark 'COMBO WINGS' by the Undertaking without any authorization is misleading and deceptive and appears to be capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in prima facie violation of the provisions of section 10 of the Act, in particular section 10(2)(a) of the Act.
","The issues identified by the Commission are therefore as follows:
 
A. Whether the Respondent's product labelling and packaging is misleadingly similar to that of the Complainant's K&N Packaging and if so, whether such confusing resemblance is deceptive and amounts to the ""fraudulent use of another's....... product labelling or packaging"" within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act;
 
B. Whether the use of the term/mark 'Combo Wings' by the Respondent, in the absence of authorization from the Complainant, amounts to the ""fraudulent use of another's trademark..."" within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act;
 
C. Whether, the Respondent's product labelling and packaging and/or use of the mark 'Combo Wings' amount to the ""distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests"" of the Complainant within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(a) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act.
 
","In view of the Respondent's violations of section 10 of the Act, the Commission hereby imposes on it a penalty of:
 
i. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act; 
ii. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
The Respondent is therefore liable to pay a sum of Pakistani Rupees 20 Million (PKR 20,000,000).
The Commission further directs the Respondent to cease use of the contentious copycat packaging for its frozen and/or processed meat product within one month. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's products.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order.
In terms of the above, SCN No.1/2014 is hereby disposed of.
","The factual and legal analysis herein below shall be structured according to the sequence and order of the three pertinent issues demarcated above as Issue A, B and C.
ISSUE A:
12. Section 10(2)(d) of the Act provides that 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging' 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In its Order in the Matter Of Complaint Filed By M/s. DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (the 'DHL Order'), the Commission with regards to the interpretation of the term 'fraudulent' stated that 'while interpreting section 10 of the Act; one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trade mark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. Rather than making it too complex by focusing on subjective ""intentions"" of the Respondents, in our considered view, it is best if we adopt simplistic approach i.e. if it can be demonstrated that the Respondents by use of the trade mark, intended to deceive the customer/consumer to gain an advantage. Keeping in view the nature of contravention, it is not the subjective intent but the objective manifestation of that intent that will establish the fraudulent use'. 
We find it useful to consider the issue of 'parasitic copying' as raised by the Complainant and discussed in the Enquiry Report. According to the definition quoted in the Enquiry Report, 'parasitic copying' or 'copycat' packaging' 'is the practice of designing the packaging of a product in a way that gives it the general look and feel of a competing, well-known brand (typically the market leader). In cases of both parasitic copying and a contravention of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, there exists an element of wilful deceitfulness along with free-riding and passing off.
The Respondent's argument regarding a correlation between the colour red and hunger is found to be one-dimensional and unconvincing. While a psychological connection between appetite and colours may or may not exist, the Commission considers that unless a specific colour was denoted as a standardized requirement to be followed by all food processing and packaging companies, or even inherently related to the properties or functions of a product, its copying in the presence of a market leader already using it would require a more compelling justification.
In order to provide further factual clarity, it is the Commission's view that the only real and meaningful distinguishing factor between the K&N Packaging and that of the Respondent's, is the existence of the parties respective trademarked logos i.e. ""K&N's"" and ""Dawn Foods"" on the front side of the product packaging. If such logos were hypothetically to be hidden or removed, it would in fact be visually impossible to identify and distinguish the origin of the products as belonging to which of the two competitors. The Commission's concern of mimicry and confusing similarity is further heightened by the fact that both parties' products, being of the same nature, are predominantly displayed for sale side by side, adjacent to each other in large common freezers located at retail stores, supermarkets and other points of sale across the country. 
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act.
 
ISUUE B: 
It is observed that the Enquiry Report at paragraph 4.20 states that the term ""Combo Wings"" is generic, and part of common usage. The SCN however has erroneously referred to the term as the Complainant's distinctive trademark based on the averments by the Complainant in its Complaint. The Complainant did not, at the time of lodging its Complaint with the Commission, own any trademark rights in the said term. As per the documents on the record, while the Complainant had in fact filed an application for the registration of a trademark in the name and style of ""Combo Wings"" with the Trade Marks Registry, Intellectual Property Organization, the process of advertisement and objections before acceptance of the same remained pending at the time of receipt of the Complaint by the Commission. The Complainant has incorrectly stated on record that the Registrar of Trademarks had ""accepted and approved"" the trademark in question.
Therefore, in this regard, the Commission concludes that, notwithstanding the Complainant's use of the mark ""Combo Wings"" on its K&N Packaging prior in time to the adoption of the same by Respondent, there has been no contravention by the Respondent of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the specific issue of alleged fraudulent use of another's ""trademark"". The trademark claimed to have been used without authorization must be registered with the competent authority for the Commission to proceed under this provision of the Act.
ISSUE 3:
A commercial practice is automatically considered as misleading if such marketing practice (including promoting and packaging of a product) causes confusion for the consumers in comparison to another product of a competitor and hence influences their transactional choice. Similarly, in terms of the Act, in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of section 10(2)(a) is also made out. Furthermore, parasitic copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of section 10(2)(d) and one which causes deceptive confusion for the consumer, in itself also amounts to the dissemination or distribution of misleading information to the public.
It is also pertinent to clarify here that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than section 10(2)(d) of the Act. While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section 10(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise.
The Commission further finds that the Respondent's use of the unregistered and non exclusive mark ""Combo Wings"" is an act which, when viewed in isolation, does not attract the provision of section 10(2)(a) of the Act and hence does not amount to the distribution of misleading information capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant. However, the Commission concludes as it did with regards to Issue B, that such use of the said mark in conjunction with the copied packaging and product labelling as a whole, is in fact misleading and capable of causing harm to the Complainant. Lastly, the Commission, before dealing with the penalties that are attracted in the instant matter, would like to make it abundantly clear that in reaching its decision as to the violations committed by the Respondent, it has in no way attempted to restrain or deny the Respondent its right to free trade in the relevant market. The Commission has reached its decision based solely on deceptive and misleading similarities in the products of the two parties concerned, which have arisen due to the indulgence by the Respondent in ""deceptive marking practices"" as prohibited by section 10 of the Act.

Messrs TARA CROP SCIENCES (PRIVATE) LIMITED FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES: In the matter of
 

 
","Show Cause Notice No. 11/2014 dated 22nd May, 2014, decided on 19th June, 2015.",,,"The Complainant is a fertilizer and chemical manufacturing concern, engaged in the production of urea, phosphate and allied products. The Respondent is one of a group of undertakings under the umbrella of M/s. Tara Group. It is engaged in the manufacturing and selling of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and is the undertaking behind the one-stop franchise network of 'Tara Zarai Markaz'. Both are undertakings in terms of section 2(1)(q) of the Act.
The Complainant alleged that its brand 'Tara' was being used fraudulently and illegally by the Respondent to market its products and business. It further alleged that the Respondent had resorted to the dissemination of misleading information which was capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant. The Complainant consequently submitted that they found the provisions of section 10 of the Act to be attracted by the conduct of the Respondent, hence their complaint.
 
With regard to the above, a formal enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 04 April 2014, ('Enquiry Report'). Based on the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report, a SCN was issued to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before the Commission on 10 June 2014. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
10. WHEREAS, in terms of Paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, it appears that the use of trademarks of the Complainant by the Undertaking, without seeking permission and any authorization, through its advertisements and marketing campaigns disseminated the information that misleads the consumers regarding the origin of products being sold at the TARA ZARAI MARAKAZ owned and controlled by the Undertaking, and also gives an impression that the exclusive franchise network of TARA ZARAI MARKAZ are affiliates/franchise/branch of the Complainant, which appears to be false/misleading information that is lacking a reasonable basis, related to method or place of production, suitability for use or quality of goods/services in violation of subsection (1) of section 10, in particular, clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
11. WHEREAS, in terms of paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, the Undertaking was using the trademark of the Complainant fraudulently and without Complainant's authorization on the facades, nearby boards and hoardings of its exclusive franchise network one-stop shops i.e. TARA ZARAI MARKAZ for advertisement/marketing purposes, which constitutes 'deceptive marketing practices' in terms of subsection (1) of Section 10, in particular, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
12. WHEREAS, in terms of the paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, the unauthorized use of Complainant's trademark by the Undertaking on the facades, nearby boards and hoardings of their exclusive franchise network one-stop shops i.e. TARA ZARAI MARKAZ for advertisement/marketing purposes, prima facie, is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of subsection (1) of section 10, in particular, clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
","The issues identified are therefore as follows:
 
(a) Whether the Commission can take cognizance of the complaint during the pendency of Civil Suit No 525/2012;
 
(b) Whether the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' in its franchise network named 'Tara Zarai Markaz' in the presence of the Complainant's products in the market which include the same term, amounts to a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(a), (b) and/or (d) of the Act.
","In view of the Respondent's violation of section 10 of the Act, the Commission hereby imposes on it a penalty of:
 
(i) Pakistani Rupees Five Hundred Thousand (PKR 500,000) for contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
 
(ii) Pakistani Rupees Five Hundred Thousand (PKR 500.000) for contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(b) of the Act;
The Respondent is therefore liable to pay a sum of Pakistani Rupees One Million (PKR 1,000,000).

The Commission further directs the Respondent to immediately cease solitary use of the distinct term 'Tara', as in its present form, in its exclusive franchise network `Tara Zarai Markaz'. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the franchise network is renamed so as to make it perfectly clear that its business has no connection with the Complainant's brand or products.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order, and is reprimanded from indulging in deceptive marketing practices in the future at the risk of severe penal consequences.
In terms of the above, SCN No.11/2014 is hereby disposed of.
","With respect to the maintainability of concurrent proceedings before the Commission, and its jurisdiction in light of the pendency of Civil Suit No. 525/2012, the Respondent raised the contention that the subject matter and prayers of both the cases were the same, and therefore fell under the ambit of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, (the 'C.P.C.'). While this issue has previously been addressed in the Enquiry Report, since it was raised again at the hearing stage, we find it necessary to provide a brief explanation anew.
We find this argument to be without merit. Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of 'res sub judice'. The purpose behind the provision, as explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits' pending in 'courts'.
Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The relevant portion is reproduced below for convenience:
Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act XLV of 1860), and the Commission shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi-judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'court' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court. Furthermore, the settled interpretation of section 10 of the C.P.C. provides that for the section to be applicable, the two suits must be pending before courts of competent jurisdiction. In Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Messrs Azeem Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. for example, it was held by the Sindh High Court that where proceedings are not in the nature of a civil suit and are instead special proceedings provided for under special law, the provisions of section 10 of the C.P.C. would not be attracted.
With respect to the second issue, we will begin by demarcating the boundaries of the matter under discussion. Both parties have made extensive submissions with regard to their trademarks, both registered and unregistered, and alleged infringements thereof. At the very outset therefore, we find it pertinent to clarify that the mandate of the Commission encompasses the protection and promotion of competition. While this includes the protection of competition against fraudulent use of trademarks, which serve to indicate proprietary interests of undertakings, it does not extend to the allocation thereof. The granting of the proprietary rights in intellectual property remains the sole domain of the Intellectual Property Organization (the 'IPO'), and the Commission cannot make any determination in this regard. Neither should the discussion in the order be construed to give credence to either party's trademark claim.

In view of all of the above therefore, we find that the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' constitutes dissemination of misleading information which is doubtlessly capable of harming the Complainant's business interests, which is a violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act. We also finds that the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' in the name of its exclusive franchise network constitutes a deceptive marketing in terms of section 10(2)(b) and thus amount to a violation of section 10(1) of the Act.

SHAMIM AKHTAR and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Appeals Nos.861 to 863 of 2002, decided on 24th April, 2015.",,,"The facts leading to the present litigation may be succinctly put forth as follows. The appellant Messrs Wella Aktineesellschaft, is a company registered under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing and exporting cosmetic items etc. On 19-7-1971, the appellant got registered two marks, ""WELLAFORM"" (word) and ""WELLAFLEX"" (word), bearing registration numbers 55811 and 55812, respectively. Additionally, the appellants already had the registered trademark in respect of ""WELLA with Device"", bearing registration number 8376, dated 28-9-1949 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""Trade marks""). The aforesaid Trademarks were all registered under Class - 3, as being ""soap, perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, products for cleaning, conditioning and embellishing the hair, including hair shampoos, dry shampoos, hair lotions, hair dressing creams, hair care products, hair sprays, permanent waving solutions, bleaching preparations, neutralizing agents, hair dyes, hair colouring products, hair fixing preparations, hair toning preparations, hair setting lotions"". The appellant also duly applied for the renewal of ""WELLAFORM"" and ""WELLAFLEX"" trademarks, which were renewed up till 19-7-1993. With respect to the trade mark ""WELLA with device"", their registration was also renewed from 28-9-1986 up till 28-9-2001.
 
The appellant, however, could not freely sell their products in Pakistan, in relation to which these Trademarks were registered, from the year 1979 to 1985 due to ban on the import of these products as per the Import Policy Orders 1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan.
 
As it transpires from the record the respondent No. 1, which is claimed to be a partnership concern carrying on the business of manufacturing and trading in cosmetics and allied products, as per their claim started using the trademark ""WELLA"" since the year 1984 and subsequently applied for its registration through T.M.A. No. 87457 in Class-3, which application for registration met with an objection that the Trademarks of the appellant, bearing Nos. 8376 (""Wella with Device""), 55811 (""WELLAFORM"") and 55812 (""WELLAFLEX"") conflicted with the trademark ""WELLA"" sought to be registered. Thus, on 9-8-1986, respondent No. 1, filed rectification applications bearing numbers 17/86, 18/86 and 19/86, regarding ""WELLAFORM"", ""WELLAFLEX"" and ""WELLA with device"", respectively, before respondent No. 2, seeking expunction of these registered Trademarks, as according to respondent No. 1, the appellant had registered these Trademarks without any bona fide intention to use them in relation to the goods falling in class-3 and had in fact failed to use them since their registration.
","whether ""special circumstance"" existed in a case which justified non-user of the mark by the registered proprietor within the meaning of section 37(3) of the Act is to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case. The important factor however, to be kept in mind while deciding the above fact is whether the actual non-user of the trade mark resulted on account of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor to abandon the mark or on account of certain other factor which would amount to special circumstances for such non-user. Here, again, while considering the other factors, it is not merely the attendant or attached circumstance to any particular individual business which is relevant but a special circumstances of the kind which affects or applies to all the traders in that particular trade. 
Conversely, Mr. Arshad Ali Chaudhry, learned Advocate Supreme Court for respondent No.1 contended that it is an admitted position from the case record that the three Registered Trademarks, regarding which respondent No.1 had moved applications under section 37(1)(b) (ibid) against the appellant, were registered in their favour on 28-9-1949, 19-7-1971 and 19-7-1971, respectively, but in Pakistan there was no use of these trademarks by the appellant Company throughout the subsequent period. Thus, the conclusion recorded by the respondent No.2 in his order dated 21-9-1988, as upheld by the High Court in its impugned judgment dated 19-4-2006, is based on proper appreciation of facts and correct interpretation of law.","The upshot of above discussion is that the High Court in its impugned judgment as well as the Registrar/respondent No.2, in his orders dated 21-9-1988, wrongly invoked the provisions of section 37(1)(b) of the Act of 1940 for ordering removal of registered trademarks of the appellant.
Foregoing are the reasons for our short order dated 24-4-2015, passed in these appeals, which reads as under:-
""Having heard the arguments of the learned ASC for both the parties, for the reasons to follow separately, these appeals are allowed, the impugned judgment and the three orders dated 21-9-1988, passed by respondent No.2 are set aside, Resultantly, Rectification Cases Nos.17, 18 and 19 of 1986 are dismissed and the registered trademarks of the appellant are restored.""
 
","Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use:---(1) Subject to the provisions of section 33, a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application in the prescribed manner by any person aggrieved to a High Court or to the Registrar, on the ground either-
 
(a) That the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or, in a case to which the provisions of section 36 apply, by the company concerned, and that there has in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of the application; or 
(b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application, a continuous period of five years or longer elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being:
 
Provided that, except where the applicant has been permitted under subsection (2) of section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the Tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark, the Tribunal may refuse an application made under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods, if it is shown that there has been, before the relevant date or during the relevant period, as the case may be, bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description, being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
 
(2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered:
(a) the circumstances referred to in clause (b) of subsection (1) are shown to exist so far as regards non- use of the trade mark in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in a particular place in Pakistan (otherwise than for export from Pakistan), or in relation to goods to be exported to a particular market outside Pakistan; and
(b) a person has been permitted under subsection (2) of section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under a registration extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold, or otherwise traded in, or in relation to goods to be so exported, or the Tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,
 
on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar, the Tribunal may impose on the registration of the first mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use.
An applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of subsection (1) or of subsection (2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates.""A careful reading of the above reproduced provision of law qua the scheme of the Act of 1940 reveals that it is a penal provision aimed to work as deterrent for those, seeking Registration of any trademark under the Act of 1940 with some ulterior motive, which they do not intend to use or there had been in fact no bona fide use of their trademark in relation to those goods for a specified period. But for seeking the relief of removal/revocation of a registered trademark under section 37(1)(b) (ibid), specific minimum timeframe of five years has been provided during which there had been no bona fide use of such trademark by its proprietor, which is to be computed from a date one month before the date of application submitted by any aggrieved person in this regard. In the present case, as mentioned earlier, the three identical applications under sections 37, 38 and 46 of the Act of 1940 were submitted by respondent No.1 for seeking removal of registered trademarks of the appellant on 9-8-1986, precisely, with the same assertions that there was no bona fide use thereof from the side of appellant for a period of over five years by that time and since the year 1984, Trademark ""WELLA"" was honestly used by the respondent No.1, thus, the three registered trademarks Nos.8376, 55811 and 55812 in class-3 of the registered trademarks were prejudicial to their interest and liable to be removed/cancelled.
Looking to the case of respondent No.1 for grant of requisite relief, claimed by them in their applications under section 37 of the Act of 1940, submitted before respondent No.2, it is also relevant to mention that in the year 1984 for the first time they had started using the trademark ""WELLA"" for their products under class-3, when the three registered trademarks of the appellant were already in field for a considerable long period. In such circumstances, mere assertion of respondent No.1 that adoption of such trade mark was after due search undertaken by them and bona fide, is not free from serious doubts. More so, in the circumstances when no material in support of such plea was placed on record and the trademarks of the appellant were well known and recognized internationally. It may also be added here that the burden of proof regarding the two material facts, (a) whether there was no bona fide use of the Registered Trademarks by the appellant for a continuous period of five years upto a date one month before the date of the application without any lawful excuse or special circumstances as envisaged under section 37(3) ibid, and (b) whether the attempt of respondent No.1 for seeking registration of word ""WELLA"" as their trademark was bona fide, was squarely upon respondent No.1, which was to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, so as to invoke its penal consequences against the appellant, but, as discussed above, they failed to discharge.
In addition to it, the observations of respondent No.2, contained in his orders dated 21-9-1988, that in case of ban on goods in class-3 under the import policies issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan for the years 1981-82 to 1984- 85, the appellant could have appointed some registered user under section 39 of the Act of 1940, or they could have assigned their trademark by invoking section 28 of the Act of 1940, or granted license to some person to avoid the penal consequences of section 37(1)(b) ibid, are equally without force as the Act of 1940 does not envisage any such compulsion to avoid the consequence of Government ban, which could be justly and fairly considered as special circumstances in the trade within the meaning of section 37(3) ibid and not to any intention of appellant to abandon or not to use their trade marks.

REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS, TRADE MARK REGISTRY and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Petitions Nos.2066 to 2068 of 2013, decided on 20th January, 2015.
 ",,,"Facts in brief, appear to be that Messrs International Foodstuff Company of UAE, (hereinafter abbreviated as IFFCO) the respondent No.2 herein, through Application No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997 applied for the registration of Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" for the goods in Class 29, which inter alia included ""edible oils, and fat; ghee; margarine"". Application inviting opposition for the said trade mark was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-2-2003 published on 14-6-2003, to which the petitioner filed Opposition No. 481 of 2003.

IFFCO, through yet another Application No. 189056 dated 1-8-2005, applied for the registration of trade mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-8-2005, published on 21-8-2005 to which also the petitioner filed opposition No.835/2006.

Petitioner adopted for itself Trade Mark styled as ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"", for the goods in Class 29 and applied for its registration through Application No. 179894, dated 24-8-2002, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-1-2005, published on 11-11-2005, registration of which was challenged by the respondent No.2 through opposition No.01/2006 on the strength of their earlier Application for registration No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997.

All the Applications for the Registration of the competing mark and oppositions thereto, filed by the rival claimants under section 14(1) of the Act, 1940 were taken up, heard and decided by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks, through common order dated 29-9-2009. The Registrar of Trade Marks, in consideration of facts that the IFFCO through evidence has established to the satisfaction of Registrar that they are the originator, proponent and prior user of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"", which mark is not only registered in various jurisdictions but is also used in Middle Eastern and various other countries since 1990. In Pakistan, they started import of its goods (Oil and Ghee) under said brand name or Trademark since 1996, which was supplemented by various invoices evidencing import and use into Pakistan ever since, whereas, the petitioner adopted the competing mark and applied for its registration on 24-8-2002, after more than a decade of its adoption by the IFFCO. Consequently, both the Applications for the Registration of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, made by the IFFCO and their opposition to the Registration of the Trade Mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner were allowed and the Application for registration of impugned mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner and their Opposition Applications were also dismissed.","Learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner contended that both the marks are quite distinct. It was argued that thorough search was made in the Trade Marks Registry, and as per search report dated 23-10-2002 it was revealed that registered mark is ""nil"" and two applications in class 29 were pending for different products, and in market search, according to learned counsel for the petitioner, similar products were not available, therefore, bona fide and in good faith petitioner had adopted the mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" for Banaspati Ghee, Cooking Oil, Edible Oil, and Palm Oil.
Contentions of the learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner are not substantiated from the record. The official search report (Memorandum) dated 23-10-2002 discloses that IFTCO's Application No.140853 for the trade mark HAYAT, was already pending in class 29 for ""Meat, fish, country and games; meat extracts, preserved dried and cooked fruits and vegetables; jellies; jam; fruit sauces; eggs, milk product; edible oils and fats; ghee; margarine; being goods included in class 29"" (page 41 in CPLA in 2067/13) (emphasis supplied), therefore, it cannot be urged that the petitioners were not aware of the adoption and use of Trademark 'HAYAT' by IFFCO.","No other grounds were urged. For what has been discussed above, order dated 29-9-2009 passed by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks and the impugned order dated 12-9-2013 passed by High Court in appeals, could not be interfered with. Consequently, the listed Civil Petitions are dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.","It may be observed that section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 forbids registration of trade mark and or a part of the trade mark that may comprise of or embraces, any scandalous design or any matter the use of which would by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice (emphasis added). Likewise section 10(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, puts a clog on the registration of trade mark in respect of any goods and or description of goods which is identical with a trade mark belonging to a different proprietor and either already registered in any of the acceding state in respect of same goods or descriptions of goods or ""which so nearly resembled such trade mark as to be likely deceive or cause confusion"". 
As regards contention of learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner that both the marks are quite distinct and dissimilar and there is no likelihood of confusion and or deception. According to him, use of prefix FAROOQ'S, the trading name of the petitioner to the word 'Hayat', distinguishes petitioners good from that of IFFCO. It may be observed that merely adding a prefix and or suffix to already existing trademark will not save the petitioner from the clutches of section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1940, which prohibits registration of a trade mark or a part of trade mark, which is ""likely to deceive or cause confusion"". Trade Marks Act, 1940 (as succeeded by Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, which came into force on 12-4-2004 per S.R.O. No.212(I)/2004) not only protect consumers, but also traders who adopt a particular trademark, which distinguishes their goods, products and services from other competing traders, producers and service providers. The Court also took note of the fact that many trade marks were already registered with prefix ""SUN"" This court allowed respondent the use of LIGHT within certain territorial bound and by adding its trade name SULTAN before LIGHT. Case of Ekhlas Ahmed 1980 SCMR 625, is of no help to the petitioner rather goes against the Petitioner. In the cited case, this Court itself examined the competing mark by examining the copy of carton of ""VEST"" applied for registration, with that of the trade mark ""VEET"" of the foreign based company and found visual and phonetic similarity between both the mark and declined to interfere in the finding recorded by High Court.
In instant case adoption of dominant feature being ""HAYAT"" is not only strikingly similar but is identical as noted above, merely adding prefix of ""FAROOQ'S"" in inconspicuous manner to the dominant or striking feature of the existing trademark HAYAT is of no consequence. The prefix ""FAROOQ'S"" as used by the petitioner in instant case does not eclipse, overshadows or obscures the dominating mark HAYAT in a way that may distinguish his goods with that of the goods of the IFFCO.
It is not very uncommon that unscrupulous traders or the manufacturers tend to confuse and or mislead consumers of goods of known or popular brands by taking shield and protection under various other laws governing intellectual property rights namely Patent, Merchandise, Designs, Trade Marks and or Copy Rights. There is growing tendency of using such terms interchangeably or treating such terms synonymously. It may be observed that there may be some similarities and overlapping in intent and purport of such rights, but rights of a proprietor/owner in each namely trademark, merchandise mark, Patent and Design and or Copyrights govern different category of intellectual properties and recognize host of different and special rights, obligations and remedies in their respective domain. There is growing tendency of misappropriating rights in one type of intellectual property by seeking protection under different statute governing altogether different intellectual property. Most abused are rights in trade marks under the garb of copyrights, later aims to protect original works of art or creative articulation may be of a trade mark in any tangible medium of expression, whereas, trademarks is associated with the goods for the purpose of indicating or so to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the rights, either as a proprietor or as registered user, to use or apply the trade mark on his goods. Trade Marks Act, 1940 protects the proprietor to use the trademark on his goods, and prevent others competitors from using and applying identical and or confusingly similar trade mark on their goods of similar class or description. There is no prohibition under the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for the competitors/traders from making, producing or marketing same or similar goods, only restriction placed is on the use and or adoption of same or deceptively and or confusingly similar trade mark. A trader may make or market or sell same or similar category of goods falling in same class but under different brand name or trade mark that clearly distinguishes its goods from same category or class of goods. Petitioner may continue to manufacture, produce and market its competing and similar goods under class 29, but under different brand name or trade mark.
It may be noted that Practice of using copyright as a substitute for the trademark was deprecated and defence of the infringer resting on registration of copyright was sternly rejected in large number of cases including cases reported as Tapal Tea (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Co. (2002 CLD 1113), Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), Messrs ADT Services AG v. ADT Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (2005 CLD 1546), Muhammad Wahid v. Adnan Memon (2010 CLD 450). In most of the reported cases, the Courts have rightly desired amendments to protect valuable rights and obligations in intellectual property under various statutes regulating such rights and obligation and arrest, misuse and abuse of such statute to the determent of honest and truthful traders and entrepreneurs.",MWA/F-8/SC Petition dismissed.,Dismissed.

","Suit Nos.1461 and 1584 of 2013, decided on 19th January, 2015.",,,"IMC and Axact represent two large business houses, the former being part of the well known Jang/Geo group while the latter (on its own showing) is engaged in the information technology (IT) business and now intends to move into the multi-media world of broadcast by way of television, print and digital media and entertainment. Classes 38 and 41 relate to services, the former encompassing telecommunication services while the latter relates to ""education, providing of training, entertainment, sporting and cultural activities"". IMC claims to be the proprietor of ""Bol"" as a registered trademark in class 41. Its case is that it was entered on the Register of Trade Marks as the proprietor of the mark on or about 7-11-2013 on its application No. 238904, which was filed on 11-6-2007. It claims to have another application No. 195773 pending for registration of ""Bol"" as a trademark in class 38. That application appears to have been filed on or about 15-5-2004. There is apparently another application, 342080, that IMC has pending for registration of ""Bol"" in class 38, though this application was filed many years later (on or about 19-6-2013). Be that as it may, IMC's grievance is that Axact intends to use and/or has started using ""Bol"" in a manner that infringes its registered trademark (in terms of the aforementioned -application No. 238904). Suit 1461 of 2013 is therefore essentially a straightforward suit for trademark infringement. C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 has been filed therein to restrain Axact from infringing the aforesaid trademark. The suit was filed on 19-11-2013 and the said application came up before me on the same day, when I made an ad interim order. That order continues to remain in the field.
Axact strongly contests IMC's claim. Its case is that it is entitled to have ""Bol"" registered as a trademark in terms as stated above, for which it has as many as 156 applications pending in various classes. Axact's case is that there is in fact no such registration and that IMC has forged, fabricated and manipulated the official record to claim a right which it does not have and to which it is not entitled. More precisely, its case is that application No. 238904 on the basis of which IMC claims its registered trademark was not made in relation to ""Bol"" at all but rather in respect of an altogether different mark. However, subsequently the record was manipulated and fabricated to show that IMC had a registered trademark. y this application, Axact seeks interim injunctive relief to restrain IMC from claiming to be the ""owner/proprietor/applicant"" for registration of ""Bol"" and for it to be restrained from pursuing the three applications mentioned above, i.e., application Nos. 238904, 195773 and 342080. The second application filed by Axact was C.M.A. 13904 of 2013. By this application Axact sought an order that the Nazir of the Court take the entire record in relation to application Nos. 238904 and 195773 in his custody. The said application was allowed by a learned single Judge on 13-12-2013. 
","The principal contest between IMC and Axact over the use and registration of the word ""Bol"" as a trademark in classes 38 and 41.
Whether IMC's application No. 238904 for ""Bol"" as a registered trademark was valid and properly registered.
Whether Axact's allegations of forgery, fabrication, and manipulation of the official record by IMC have merit.
The legality and validity of the certificate of registration of ""Bol"" relied upon by IMC.
The propriety of the Registrar's routine practice of advertising applications before acceptance.","Subject to, and in terms of, what has been stated herein above, both C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 in Suit 1461 of 2013 and C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 in Suit 1584 of 2013 are dismissed.","A certificate purporting to be issued under the hand of the Registrar as to any entry, matter or thing that he is authorised by this Ordinance or the rules to make or do shall be prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and of the contents thereof, or of the matter or thing having been done or not done.
Registration.---(1) Where an application has been accepted and (a) no notice of opposition has been given within the period referred to in subsection (2) of section 28 ... the Registrar shall, within such period as may be prescribed, register the trade mark, unless it appears to him having regard to matters coming to his notice since he accepted the application that it was accepted in error.
On the registration of a trade mark the Registrar shall publish the registration in the prescribed manner and issue to the applicant a certificate in the prescribed form of registration, sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.
Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity.---In all legal proceedings relation to a trade mark registered under this Ordinance ... the fact that a person is registered as proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmission thereof.
if no opposition is filed to the mark as advertised within the stipulated period (or no application is made, within the said period, for extension of time) to make an entry on the Register in the prescribed manner (section 33(1)). Such entry is prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration of the mark in favor of the applicant as the proprietor thereof (section 43). Once the entry has been made the Registrar is bound to issue an appropriate certificate to the applicant under the seal of the Trade Marks Registry (section 33(4)). Such certificate is prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and the contents thereof (section 11). In a suit for infringement of a registered trademark when such a certificate is produced, in the normal course it has the effect as just stated. This may be only on a prima there basis but that, after all, is all that is required for an application for interim injunctive relief. 
In my view, given that the certificate relied upon is not issued by the Registrar himself, the position adopted by the official defendants in the Written Statement must be given primacy. The position there is that no certificate ""duly signed and stamped by the competent authority"" has been issued. Furthermore, I note that in the Written Statement, the official defendants have avoided stating that, in fact, ""Bol"" is properly registered as a trademark in favor of IMC in class 41 on the Register. The certificate must be issued by the Registrar or by an officer of the Registry authorized in terms of section 7(2). Mrs. Nasreen Akhtar was obviously not the Registrar and from what has been said in para 18 of the Written Statement, not authorized to issue the certificate. On any view of the matter therefore, the stance of the official defendants is clear; there is no certificate of or evidencing, registration in the field as has, or can have, legal validity. Indeed, section 11(1) appears to suggest that this is all the evidence that is required. Therefore, if such certificate, as presented by the plaintiff, is categorically denied by the Registrar, then the effect of such denial is clear: there is no prima facie basis on which it can be concluded that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark claimed. 
Sections 27 and 28 of the 2001 Ordinance, as presently relevant. Section 27 requires is that if, after examination of the application and the required search, the Registrar is of the view 'that there are any objections to the application, he must notify the applicant and give him an opportunity to either satisfy the Registrar that the application is, in fact and law, compliant with statutory requirements or to amend it suitably to bring it in line with what is required and permissible. If either of these eventualities is not met, then the Registrar must refuse to accept the application. 
Opposition to registration---(1) When an application far registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted, to be advertised in the prescribed manner:
Provided that the Registrar may cause an application to be advertised before acceptance if it relates to a trade mark to which clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 6 applies, or in any other case where it appears to him that it is expedient by reason of any exceptional circumstances so to do, and where an application has been so advertised the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, advertise it again when it has been accepted, but shall not be bound so to do. It will be seen that this provision was similar to section 28(1). (Section 14 of the previous Act was similar to the present section 27.) There are however two important differences. Firstly, the proviso to section 15(1) comprised of two parts. It could be invoked either (a) in respect of a mark to which section 6(1)(e) of the 1940 Act applied or (b) in any other case where ""exceptional circumstances"" were found to exist. The first proviso to section 28(1) only applies if ""exceptional circumstances"" exist and not otherwise. Secondly, the second proviso to section 28(1) is new: it had no equivalent in the 1940 Act. Now, section 6 of the 1940 Act provided for the distinctiveness that was required of a mark for it to be registered. Subsection (1) provided that a mark would not be registered unless it consisted of any one of the ""essential particulars"" as stated in clauses (a) to (e) thereof.
under the 1940 Act a practice may have arisen that in respect of all applications in which section 6(1)(e) applied to the mark sought to be registered, the Registrar routinely allowed the application to be advertised before acceptance. Once the 2001 Ordinance came into effect, this practice has continued, essentially as a holdover from what was happening previously. However, if so (and even otherwise), in my view such a practice and the routine application of the first proviso under section 28(1) is clearly contrary to law. This is so because the first proviso can apply if, and only if, ""exceptional circumstances"" are shown to exist and not otherwise. This requirement applies to all cases and there is no separate category as was to be found in the proviso to section 15(1). Now, ""exceptional circumstances"" are precisely that: circumstances of such a rare or unusual nature as would warrant departure from the main rule, namely that an application is only to be advertised if accepted. 
I turn to the second proviso to section 28(1) which is mandatory. he manner in which the Registrar is to ""simultaneously notify"" the ""exceptional circumstances"" which led him to allow advertisement before acceptance can only be for such circumstances to be stated in the advertisement itself. While this follows ineluctably from the language of the second proviso, the point is expressly made in Rule 29 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004. Sub-rule (1) lists the particulars that must go in the advertisement and clause (i) thereof requires that the ""details of special circumstances, if any, under the proviso to subsection (1) of section 28"" must be given.
I conclude that at present IMC has failed to make out a prima facie case that it is the proprietor of the registered trademark ""Bol"" in class 41 on its application No. 238904. Accordingly, its present application is Suit 1461 of 2013, C.M.A. 12775 of 2013, must necessarily fail. Subject to what is stated hereafter, this application is therefore dismissed and the ad interim order made earlier stands recalled and vacated. As noted above, the official defendants have indicated that there is some inquiry ongoing at the Registry with regard to IMC's various applications and in particular application No. 238904. Taking up this application I direct that the official defendants must conclude such inquiry (if not already completed) within 30 days from the date of announcement of this Order. No opportunity of hearing need be given to either IMC or Axact (or any other person) but the results of the inquiry and the report thereon must be provided to them, and a copy of the same placed on the record in both Suits. In particular the report must address and record a clear finding whether, on IMC's application No.238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark. If the finding is that there is no such entry, then IMC's application No. 238904 shall be deemed pending. Since it was advertised under the first proviso in a manner contrary to law, the Registrar must then consider whether the application is to be accepted in terms as required by section 27 read with any other applicable provisions. If accepted (either absolutely or conditionally) then the application must be re-advertised and Axact (and any other person) shall then be entitled to file opposition on such re-advertisement in accordance with law. In its opposition, Axact will be entitled to take all such grounds as are admissible including the ground (as appears to be its case) that the application has been unlawfully allowed to be amended in violation of the first proviso to section 27(7). On the other hand, if the finding recorded in the inquiry is that on IMC's application No. 238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark, then the date of such finding or the date of this Order (whichever is later) shall be deemed to be the date of the decision of the Registrar and the date on which the trademark is, in fact, registered. Axact will be entitled to its statutory remedies, if any, accordingly. Furthermore, in such a situation IMC shall be entitled to renew its application for interim injunctive relief in Suit 1461 of 2013 which, if filed, will be taken up and decided on its own merits.
I turn to Axact's application C.M.A. 13905/2013 in its Suit 1584 of 2013. I can see no reason why this application should be allowed. As already noted in respect of application No. 195773, the same has been advertised and is being opposed by Axact. Application No. 342080 is still under examination at the Registry and will be dealt with in accordance with law, especially as explained herein above. The third application, No. 238904, has already been dealt with herein above. Since all the applications can be, and will be, dealt with under the relevant provisions of the 2001 Ordinance, I see no reason why an interim injunctive order should be made in relation thereto in terms as sought. Subject to what has been stated herein before, C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 is therefore dismissed.
In order to enable further proceedings to be taken, both in terms as stated herein above and under the 2001 Ordinance, the Nazir is directed to return the record taken by him in custody under the order made in Suit 1584 of 2013. However, before doing so he must suitably endorse/mark each page for identification purposes and retain a copy of the record so endorsed/marked and provide copies of the same to IMC and Axact. The record will be handed over to an officer not below the rank of Deputy Registrar who must be authorized in this regard by the Registrar himself. The Registrar must provide, on a monthly basis, copies (suitably marked and under an appropriate letter of intimation) to the Nazir of all documents subsequently filed in the record being returned and printouts of any computer entries made, amended, varied or deleted (whether in respect of the Register or otherwise). The Nazir will keep such copies along with the earlier copy.
I note from the file of Suit 1461 of 2013 that Axact has certain applications pending under Order VII, Rule 11 and section 10, C.P.C. on account of the Lahore suit. These applications may be listed and be heard and disposed of on their own merits notwithstanding what has been stated in the foregoing. I may also note that whatever has been said herein above is tentative in nature and the two Suits, should they go to trial, will be disposed of on their own merits and in terms of the evidence as recorded.
Finally, the Registrar is directed, since the matter is of importance and general application and interest, that paras 13 to 19 of this Order (both inclusive) and this para (and only these paras) must be published in the next issue of the Trade Marks Journal as is published on or after 15 days from the date of announcement of this Order. A copy of the relevant issue of the Journal must be sent to the Additional Registrar (OS), who will ensure that it is placed on the file of Suit 1461 of 2013.

FECTO CEMENT LIMITED through Chief Executive Officer and 3 others---Respondents
 

 
","First Appeal from Order No.213 of 2012, decided on 28th September, 2012.",,,"Appellant herein is a public limited company and claims to be the creator, originator, owner and user of trademark ""P"" in stylized form (hereafter stylized ""P"" logo) which it claims to be using since the inception of its business of cement manufacturing, marketing and selling for more than two decades. It claims to have launched a new brand of cement for export to Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics with the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device. It is claimed that cement bags with the said trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device were designed and printed for the appellant first time by a company called Syntronics Limited in May 2010.
The appellant claims to have engaged respondent No.3, a Pakistani company having its office in Peshawar as its distributor and submits that respondent No.3, as a distributor of the appellant, entered into a contract with an Afghan company named Shirkat-ul-Faisal and started exporting cement to Afghanistan under the trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device. It is alleged that after some time relationship between the appellant and respondent No.3 came to an end, whereafter respondent No.3 contracted appellant's competitor, respondent No.1, and started exporting cement to Shirakat-ul-Faisal in Afghanistan under appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device in utter disregard of law and violation of business ethics and with dishonesty and mala fide.
To restrain respondents from using the aforesaid trademark, the appellant filed a suit for infringement coupled with passing off the goods before the learned District Judge, Lahore, along with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. and the learned Additional District Judge granted a restraining order on 24th June, 2011 which was withdrawn through the impugned order dated 29-3-2012. 
The respondents resisted the suit and inter alia challenged the claim of proprietorship of the trademark by the appellant. Certain allegations about concealment of some facts concerning dealership were also raised and it was also asserted that Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited has obtained registration of Two Elephants device in Afghanistan. Strong reliance by the respondents was placed on obtaining trademark registration in Afghanistan by Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited in Afghanistan.","Whether the appellant is the prior user and owner of the disputed trademark comprising the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device and whether the respondents' use of the trademark constitutes infringement and passing off.","In the light of the above, this appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned order dated 29-3-2012, is set aside. The respondents are restrained to use the appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device till the final disposal of the suit. It is however noted that the observations made above are tentative in nature and would not influence the decision of the suit on merits after recording of evidence. As valuable rights of parties are involved it is ordered that the trial Court shall decide the suit within six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.","If Do Pheel/Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, a Director of respondent No.3, it seems inconceivable that they would continue to use it with stylized ""P"" logo, as stylized ""P"" logo is admittedly the trademark of appellant. This, prima facie, shows dishonesty on the part of the respondents. In this respect even if, for argument's sake, it is considered that Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, then if, as per respondent's own stance that their dealership was unlawfully cancelled by the appellant, it was their legal, moral and ethical duty to have only taken their alleged Two Elephants device trademark to respondents Nos.1 and 2 (Fecto Cement Limited) to start export with Two Elephants device replacing appellant's stylized ""P"" logo with that of Fecto's own logo. This was apparently not done for obvious reasons that respondents desired to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" logo as a trademark of the appellant by virtue of its use on cement exported to Afghanistan.
There is a further aspect to respondents' prima facie dishonest act and their efforts to deceive the Courts. If Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4 (Mr. S. Mehtab Hussain), a Director of respondent No.3, then it is not understandable why they would allow Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited, which is a separate entity, to register it in its name in Afghanistan and not in the name of the said respondent or respondent No.3. 
As far as Distributorship is concerned it is pertinent to note that respondents in their written statement have admitted the existence of distributorship and have referred to it as well as attached a copy of said letter in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Factual Matrix of the written statement as reproduced below:--

(1) That the plaintiff approached defendant(s) Nos.3 and 4 in order to subscribe to their services as exclusive and sole distributor(s)/dealer(s). The plaintiff, at all material times, represented and assured that defendant No.3 would be engaged to the exclusion of all others. It is submitted that Dho Pheel/(the two elephants) was the brainchild of defendant No.4, who is and was at all material times, the Director of defendant No.3.

(2) That the plaintiff through its General Manager (Marketing and Sales), Mr. Rizwari Butt, confirmed the appointment of defendant No.4 as the authorized Sole Distributor for Afghanistan and CARs (Central Asian Republics) through a letter dated 29-3-2010. A copy of the letter dated 29-3-2010 is placed herewith as Annex-E.

(3) That the albeit it is beyond the scope of the present proceedings, it is nevertheless the case that the plaintiff flagrantly breached the Dealership Agreement, which it had struck with defendant No.3. Consequently, the latter, on the plaintiff's contractual repudiation, was but only impelled to enter into a Dealership Agreement dated 20-4-2011 with defendant No.1 (viz, Fecto Cement Limited). A copy of an email written by defendant No.4 to the General Manager of defendant No.1 substantiating these state of affairs is placed herewith as Annex -F.
The learned trial Court has stated the correct principle that in trademark cases most important factor is who is prior user of trademark. This principle is in particular applicable when none of the contesting parties is armed with a registered trademark. Despite stating the correct principle, in my humble view, the learned trial Judge committed a serious error when he concluded that the plaintiff company (appellant) did not produce any cogent and convincing material in this regard. This apparently reflects that the learned trial Judge did not pay much attention to the pleadings of the parties nor perused the documents available on the record. 
In the present case, there is admittance on the part of the respondents that respondent No.3 has acted as a distributor for the appellant and sold appellant's cement with the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device to Afghanistan. Therefore, there is no denial or challenge that the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device was not first used by the appellant and cement with this trademark was not sold in Afghanistan through respondent No.3 as a distributor of appellant and thus there is no denial that appellant is the prior user of the disputed trademark.
In my humble opinion the distributor's appointment letter and above admitted facts were sufficient to, prima facie, show that appellant was the prior user and prior owner of the Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" trademark for cement. Moreover the respondents have not explained the reason for their choice to use the stylized ""P"" logo along with Two Elephants, when respondent No.1 itself seems to be a well known company, it should have chosen to use its own independent logo and not that of its competitors. It is in particular not appreciable that big business groups resort to copying their competitors trademarks, as, prima facie, seems to be the case here.
In the light of the above, it clearly appears that the appellant has made out a prima facie case in its favour and is likely to suffer irreparable loss if the respondents are not restrained from using the stylized ""P"" logo and the Two Elephants device. I must add here that trademark rights are lifelines of businesses and unauthorized use of owner's trademark by third parties results in un-quantifiable loss and damage to its goodwill and business which is irreparable in nature. Thus the loss that the appellant is likely to suffer as a result of use of appellant's trademark by the respondents cannot be calculated in terms of monetary compensation and would be irreparable in nature. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the appellant. I must also observe that under section 46(2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 all such reliefs by way of damages, injunction, accounts are available to the proprietor of a trademark simultaneously and not as an alternate to each other and just because in addition to interim injunction a plaintiff may claim damages and compensation in a suit relating to trademark rights, interim relief cannot be denied on that ground.

BAYER AG. through Authorized Signatory and another---Plaintiffs

BAYHEALTH CARE (PRIVATE) LIMITED through Chief Executive Director, Company Secretary and another---Defendants

"," 
Suit No. 727 of 2008, decided on 27th May, 2013.",,,"The plaintiffs have filed this suit against defendant No.1 for accounts, recovery of money, damages, and perpetual and mandatory injunctions. Before dealing with the case of the plaintiffs, it is necessary to trace their background and to understand the circumstances in which they were constrained to file the present Suit.
 Plaintiff No.1 BAYER AG, which is an international chemical and pharmaceutical company incorporated and based in the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling a variety of products, as well as providing services in diverse areas such as health care, agrochemical products, organic products, specialty chemicals, industrial products, engineering materials, etc. The business and operations of plaintiff No.1 are spread almost all over the world. Plaintiff No.1 is the owner of the name 'BAYER' since 1-8-1863, when the founder of plaintiff No.1 Mr. Fredrich Bayer started his business in the name and style 'Friedr'. Bayer et comp' in partnership with one Mr. Fredrich Weskott. The partnership was converted into a joint stock company in the year 1981 in the name and style 'Farbenfabriken vorm Friedr Bayer & Co.' Plaintiff No.1 entered into the pharmaceutical business in the year 1888, for which it is well known and acknowledged throughout the world, including Pakistan. In the year 1904, plaintiff No.1 developed, adopted and started using its corporate image, the Bayer Cross Logo, wherein the word 'BAYER' appears vertically as well as horizontally within a circle, and the words intersect at the letter 'Y'. The name of plaintiff No.1 was changed in the year 1972 to its present name, that is, 'BAYER AG'. Plaintiff No.2 'Bayer HealthCare AG' is a wholly owned subsidiary of plaintiff No.1.
 In addition to their company name 'Bayer', the principal trademark 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, the plaintiffs also coined/developed/created various 'Bay' Formative Marks, that are being used by them in their pharmaceutical products all over the world. It has been claimed by the plaintiffs that the word 'Bayer' is in their exclusive use since 1863 as their trade name, company name, trademark, service mark and house mark, which as well as the Bayer Cross Logo, appear on all their products, product packaging, buildings, structures, stationery and vehicles. The plaintiffs have also claimed that they have been using 'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' as their trademarks/company names/trade names, and the Bayer Cross Logo as their logo, and in all their printed and audio-visual promotions and advertisements in Pakistan during the past several years, they have prominently and extensively used their trademarks/company names/trade names/'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE'. The plaintiffs have further claimed that the word 'Bayer' has never been used by or associated with anyone else throughout the world. Because of the use of the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks exclusively by the plaintiffs, and their extensive promotions and advertisements by them, the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks have acquired not only substantial reputation and goodwill in Pakistan, but have also created strong awareness in the general public that all the above are associated only with the plaintiffs, and all products with the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks thereon, belong exclusively to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have averred that they have been carrying on their pharmaceutical business in Pakistan for several decades in the name and style Bayer Pakistan (Private) Limited, a Pakistani subsidiary/sister concern of plaintiff No.1, which uses several trademarks of plaintiff No.1 in Pakistan, including the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, under the authority and supervision of plaintiff No.1. In order to protect their interests in their trademark 'Bayer' and 'Bay' Formative Marks, the plaintiffs have obtained their registration in Pakistan. The sale figures of the plaintiffs' products in Pakistan run into hundreds of millions of Rupees every year.
It is the case of the plaintiffs that all their products manufactured, sold and marketed in Pakistan depict the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, and in addition to the above, various pharmaceutical products bearing the marks derived from the prefix 'Bay', that is, 'Bay' Formative Marks, such as 'LIPOBAY' and 'GLUCOBAY', are being sold in Pakistan since 1991, when the said products were got registered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are also using the trademark 'BAYCUTEN' with the prefix 'Bay' in Pakistan since 1991, and the said product is still being sold. Another trademark 'BAYDAL' with the prefix 'Bay' has been recently introduced in Pakistan by the plaintiffs, and they intend to introduce in future more products in Pakistan with 'Bay' Formative Marks.
The plaintiffs have stated that in November 2007, they came to know through an advertisement in the Trade Marks Journal No.681 dated 1-10-2007, published on 31-10-2007, that defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' had filed applications with the Registrar of Copyrights for registration of trademarks 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS', as copyright. It has been alleged that, defendant No.1 had adopted and started using the aforementioned imitated 'Bay' Formative Marks in an unauthorized and mala fide manner. Through the said applications filed by defendant No.1, the plaintiffs also came to know that defendant No.1 had been incorporated as a company in the above name and style. It has been strongly alleged by the plaintiffs that, by using the prefix 'Bay' in its name and the purported trademarks, defendant No.1 has attempted to take undue advantage of the plaintiffs' well known and reputed trademark, service mark, company name and trade name, that is, 'Bayer', Bayer Cross Logo and 'Bay' Formative Marks.
","After carefully examining two authorities and the other reported cases, I feel that there is hardly anything that can be added to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court or the findings given by other Superior Courts for determining the criteria as to whether or not a case falls under the definition of infringement or passing off. As I have understood, in a case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has infringed his trademark, copyright or trade name, it is to be gauged as to whether or not the products of the plaintiff and the defendant are identical, or to what extent they are similar. The products, without any investigation or close examination, should look identical or similar in size, shape, colour/colour scheme, texture, packing, presentation, or appearance, so as to deceive the customer/consumer to purchase/use the product of the defendant without any hesitation or doubt in his mind, under the impression that he has purchased/used the product of the plaintiff. It is not necessary that the defendant's product should have all the above characteristics to look similar or identical to the product of the plaintiff; any one, or some of them, may be sufficient in some cases to create such a situation. If the customer/consumer gets deceived or becomes doubtful or confused after looking at or comparing the products of the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff will be justified in bringing an action against the defendant. In my opinion, it is not necessary that the deception or confusion was caused by the defendant deliberately or intentionally, and even unintentional deception and confusion in such cases would give rise to a cause of action to the plaintiff, as the main element is the deception and/or confusion, and not the intention of the person responsible for the deception and/or confusion. The above aspect becomes more important and applicable when the plaintiff and the defendant are operating and carrying on business in the same area/field, the nature of their business is the same or similar, and the operations and business of the plaintiff were prior in time to those of the defendant. I am also of the view that when a person, firm or company decides to start the business in a particular name and style or with a particular trademark or copyright, he/they are duty-bound to ascertain and ensure that the name and style or the trademark or copyright which they intend to use, was not being used by any other entity. If such caution is not exercised and any infringement and/or passing off is caused, the entire responsibility as to the consequences shall rest on the person/entity who uses the same or similar name and style, trademark or copyright that was already in the use of or was already owned by the other entity.","In view of the above discussion and findings, and also as the plaintiffs have successfully proven their case, the Suit is decreed with costs against defendant No.1 to the extent of Prayers (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vii) made in paragraph 26 of the plaint, and Prayers (a) and (b) made in paragraph 26.1 of the plaint, as prayed by the plaintiffs. It is hereby ordered that defendant No.1 shall immediately take all necessary steps for changing/rectifying its name in the record of defendant No.2 by ensuring that the company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, belonging to and owned by the plaintiffs, are deleted/removed from the name of defendant No.1 with immediate effect. The entire exercise shall be completed by defendant No.1 within thirty (30) days hereof. Defendant No.2, the Deputy Registrar of Companies, SECP, Karachi, is hereby directed that in case defendant No.1 does not initiate the above process or the said process is not completed within the stipulated time frame, defendant No.2 shall ensure that the registration of defendant No.1 in its present imitated name is cancelled, and the rectification in the defendant No.1's name is carried out in the above terms in letter and spirit. Defendant No.2 is further directed to submit the compliance report to this Court through the M.I.T. within one week after the expiration of the stipulated period.
The office is directed to forward copies of this judgment to the M.I.T., as well as to defendant No.2 and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad, for compliance.","In the present case, the plaintiffs have successfully established that they are the lawful owners of their company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, and the 'Bayer' Logo. The comparison and a bare perusal of the defendant No.1's name as well as the names of its products show that the prefix 'Bay' and the 'Bay' Formative Marks owned by the plaintiffs, have been used therein by defendant No.1 in a glaring and obvious manner. The name of defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' encompasses not only the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs, but also the words 'health Care', which are the part and parcel of the trade mark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' owned by the plaintiffs. Likewise, the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs distinctly, prominently and unambiguously appears in the products 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS' manufactured, sold and marketed by defendant No.1. The above similarities are of such nature that they can go unnoticed, undetected and unchecked very easily, and the same are bound to cause deception or confusion in the minds of the customers/consumers, doctors, retailers, dealers, stockists, etc., that the imitated products of defendant No.1 are those of the plaintiffs, especially when all the imitated products of defendant No.1 with its imitated name thereon, and those of the plaintiffs, are sold, marketed, used and consumed as pharmaceutical products. The similarities between the trademarks and the company/trade names of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1, are so obvious and unambiguous that because of the use of the plaintiff's prefix 'Bay' and the word 'healthCare' of the plaintiffs' trademark by defendant No.1, its products and the plaintiffs' products look identical. As such, no inquiry. or investigation is required to compare or distinguish the products. My above observations clearly show that this is a case of infringement of the plaintiff's trademarks and company/trade names by defendant No.1, and that of passing off its goods, business and services as those of the plaintiffs, especially in view of Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold that if the two marks are absolutely identical, no further probe is needed and infringement is established.
Regarding the prayer made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and the prayer for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present name of defendant No.1, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh and Sons Ltd. and another v. Azhar Wali Muhammad and 11 others, 1986 MLD 1870. In view of the cases of Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh & Sons Ltd. and Messrs ADT Services AG (supra), it is clear that the prayers made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present imitated name of defendant No.1, can be granted by this Court.
Subsection (2) of section 37 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, provides as under:--

""(2) A company shall not be registered by a name identical with that by which a company in existence is already registered, or so nearly resembling that name as to be calculated to deceive, except where the company in existence is in the course of being dissolved and signifies its consent in such manner as the registrar requires.""

In view of this mandatory provision in the Companies Ordinance, 1984, the name of defendant No.1 ought not have been entertained or registered by the Deputy Registrar concerned, as the company/trade name of defendant No.1 contains the plaintiffs' company/trade name, the trademark as well as the prefix 'Bay' Formative Marks. For the same reason, the Registrar Trademarks ought not have entertained or registered the products of defendant No.1. Both the above named authorities failed in discharging their statutory functions and duties in accordance with law. If these authorities perform their functions and duties vigilantly and in a prudent manner, the possibility of infringement and passing off can be curbed to a great extent, and unnecessary inconvenience and loss to parties as well as uncalled for litigation could be avoided.

","File No.66/REG/COMP/DHL/CCP/2011, decided on 21st December, 2012.
 ",,,Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the 'Complainant') filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission') against the Respondents. In the complaint it was alleged that the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's stylized and artistically created logo/trademark without the Complainant's permission or authorization or consent. The Commission initiated an enquiry pursuant to section 37(2) of the Act. ,"In view of the submissions made before us in the subject proceedings, following issues need deliberation:--
 
(i) whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
 
(ii) whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
 
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act,
 
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10, and
 
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
 
","The Respondents of the first category i.e. Mr. Rehan (Respondent No. 1) and ICS Courier (Respondent No. 2) were forthcoming in their conduct as discussed in Paras (36) and (37). Therefore, taking a lenient view, we are not imposing any penalty on both the Respondents; however, they are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in future, which shall otherwise entail serious consequences under the Act.
The Respondent belonging to the second category, i.e. Mr. Uzair, has also provided the documents substantiating that in fact the couriers booked by him were passed on to the Complainant and were eventually sent through the Complainant. He has also provided the details of many other undertakings using the trademark of the Complainant. Although the Respondent has assured the Commission future compliance, it is important that at least some penalty be imposed keeping in view that his practices were misleading and deceptive in terms of section 10. Particularly, the fact that he even represented himself affiliated with the Complainant by using the Complainant's trademark on his visiting card cannot be overlooked being a serious breach. Also, he did not place anything on record to demonstrate that he has discontinued such practices, after the issuance of the show cause notice. Keeping the above in view coupled with his assurance, we are restricting the penalty to Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five hundred Thousand Only).
The Respondents, namely Mr. Asif Iqbal (Respondent No. 4) and Mr. Malik M. Pervaiz Respondent No. 5) have failed in substantiating their stance and have not even demonstrated their good faith through their conduct. The contravention of section 10(1) of the Act stands established in terms of what has already been discussed above. However, we are of the view that the necessary deterrent effect would be achieved and the interests of justice served even if a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only) is imposed.
Similarly, Mr. Nauman Anwer Butt (Respondent No. 6) and Raja Asir Munir (Respondent No. 7), are doing the business in their own names i.e. DHIL and DHS respectively, yet using a logo which is deceptively similar to the Complainant's trademark for which no plausible justification has been placed forward. Based on the principles laid down by the courts in cases of 'passing off' similarity in colour, scheme, get-up, overall similarity and the broad salient features by which an ordinary illiterate customer would be misled for taking product manufactured or services rendered by defendant as that of plaintiff are the relevant factors for such determination. In our considered view in the present case, taking these factors into account we find the Respondents' marks misleading and deceptive and capable of being taken as marks of the Complainant by an ordinary consumer. On comparison these marks bear such resemblance which is likely to cause confusion and deception. It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents. While these Respondents are primarily using their own business names, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 is not relevant. Nonetheless, in the given facts and circumstances, it is in the interest of justice to deter such practices and these Respondents are also held liable to pay a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only).
The Respondents are hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behavior in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to discontinue the use of trademark of the Complainant with immediate effect and not to use it in future without due authorization. The Respondents are also directed to file within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Order, the commitments with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene provisions of section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter, along with the penalty.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondents shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.500,000 (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
 At the end, we cannot ignore the fact that during the proceedings, details of other undertakings along with the images were provided by Mr. Uzair. The Registrar is directed to forward this concern to the OFT department of this Commission for further scrutiny and independent inquiry, if deemed necessary, in terms of section 37 of the Act.
Accordingly, the Show Cause Notices Nos. 26 to 32 of 2012 issued to the Respondents are hereby disposed of in terms of this Order.
","The complaint is filed by Company Secretary Mr. Muhammad Hanif Idrees, with the Complainant's seal and supported by Board Resolution No.12 of 2011, authorizing him and CEO Mr. Sarfaraz Siddiqui to file legal documents regarding the misuse of the DHL trademark.

The complaint is valid, containing the signature of the authorized representative and supported by a power of attorney signed by Mr. Idrees.

The objection that the complaint is not filed by an authorized representative has no merit, as proven by the resolution and signatures provided. The burden of proof that such power did not exist lies on the defendant, who failed to provide contrary evidence.

Some Respondents denied the authenticity of the images in the enquiry report and claimed to have stopped using the DHL trademark. However, these images were verified by an enquiry officer, and Respondents failed to provide rebuttal evidence within the given time.

Respondent Mr. Butt claimed the Complainant encouraged using its trademark, but provided no evidence to substantiate this.

Respondent Mr. Asif Iqbal objected to the complaint, stating it mentioned ""Asir Iqbal,"" who does not work at the site. However, evidence showed ""Asir Iqbal"" was a typographic mistake, and the complaint was indeed against Mr. Asif Iqbal.

The Respondents claimed ignorance of the Competition Act and lack of intent to deceive. However, the Complainant's trademark and logo are globally recognized, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

The essential function of a trademark is to guarantee the origin of goods or services to the consumer, distinguishing them from others. The use of similar logos by the Respondents aimed to capitalize on the Complainant's goodwill, misleading consumers.

The Complainant's trademark is registered in Pakistan and over 220 countries, representing swiftness and speed.

Fraudulent use of the trademark involves misrepresentation to deceive consumers for an advantage, which the Respondents knew or should have known was unauthorized.

The conduct of the Respondents violates section 10(1) of the Act, with varying penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and the conduct of the Respondents.

Respondents Mr. Rehan and ICS Courier, who discontinued using the trademark promptly, are not penalized but are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in the future.

SHAN FOOD INDUSTRIES---Appellant

EASTERN PRODUCTS (PVT.) LTD and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Appeal No.223-K of 2011, decided on 4th July, 2012.
(Against the judgment dated 29-12-2010 passed by High Court of Sindh, Karachi in M.A. No.55 of 2004).",,,"This Appeal impugns the Judgment of the learned High Court of Sindh (Karachi) in Miscellaneous Application No.55 of 2004 whereby the appeal filed by the respondent was allowed. Consequently the Order of the Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26-6-2004 dismissing the application of the respondent for registration of its trade mark i.e. ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" was set aside.
 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985. In 1991 an advertisement appeared in the Trade mark Journal for ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" for tea in respect of the respondent which was opposed by the appellant. The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

F.A.O. No.436 of 2009, decided on 31st January, 2011.",,,"There are two restaurants located side by side at Qadafi Stadium one is owned by the appellant with registered trademark of ""Dera Restaurant"". The word ""Dera"" is in large size as compared to the 'word ""Restaurant'. The adjoining restaurant was allegedly named as ""Fazl-e-Haq Family Restaurant"" at one time but on account of appellant's success it has now been named as ""Fazl-e-Haq Dera"". The violation of appellant's registered trademark dated 28-7-2003 is alleged by the use of word ""Dera"" in the name of respondent's restaurant. The learned trial court has declined the interim relief by the impugned order dated 3-11-2009 primarily on the ground that the name of ""Fazl-e-Haq"" clearly distinguishes the said eatery from the appellant's restaurant.","Learned counsel for the respondents adds that Mr. Fazl-e-Haq owns a number of other restaurants in Lahore. The signboard of each of such restaurant bears the owner's portrait. He submits that therefore no confusion or deception is caused by the use of word Dera in the name of the respondent restaurant.
Learned counsel for the appellant has relied on Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak.) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8) and Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mill (Pvt.) Limited and others (2001 SCMR 967) to support his case. The upshot of the precedents is that similarity between the trademarks adopted by the, contesting parties should be such as to create reasonable confusion and deception in the mind of as unwary purchaser.","Accordingly, subject to the outcome of the main suit proceedings, it is ordered that the name of respondent's restaurant may include the word Dera in it only if it is written in one line and in one font of equal size as ""Fazl-e-Haq Dera"". If the respondent does not comply with the direction within one month from the date of a certified copy of this order, the appellant may approach the learned trial Court for penal action against the respondent by striking out the word Dera from its name.
 

","The statutory test for infringement is laid down in section 40 of the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. If the objected trademark is identical or deceptively similar to the registered trademark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to the goods or services for which trademark is registered, then there is a case for infringement. In the present case evidence has not yet been recorded. The respondents deny that their restaurant adjoining appellant's restaurant was ever called ""Fazl-e-Haq Family Restaurant"". It is further explained that to establish bona fides, during the course of hearing, the respondent has changed the format of its name on the signboard. The words ""Fazl-e-Haq"" are now displayed in larger size so as to undo the effect of word Dera as a distinct name.
Evidence has yet to be recorded in the present case on whether there is sufficient basis for confusion and deception to be inferred in the facts of the case. However there is merit in the appellant's contention that the two establishments being located adjacently, the respondent's restaurant on account of common word in its name has a likelihood of attracting/diverting customers away from the appellant's restaurant. Accordingly, for the reason of proximity between tie two establishments there is a likelihood that word Dera in the name of respondent's restaurant would cause confusion and deception among customers. Photograph of the latest signboard installed outside the respondent restaurant during the course of the proceedings as a step to demonstrate bona fides, has been placed on record. It does not minimize the effect of the name ""Dera"" which is written in large size but in a font that is different from the one used for the name of ""Fazl-e-Haq"".
In the circumstances and for the purpose of interim relief the said notification adopted by the respondent is not satisfactory. Consequently, the respondents are not allowed to use the word Dera distinctly from the name of Fazl-e-Haq either in terms of its placement on the signboard of the restaurant or by a different font used therefor.

","High Court Appeal No.233 of 2007 and C.M. A. No.6118 of 2005, decided on 6th October, 2009.",,,"This High Court Appeal has been filed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge, dated 4-10-2007, whereby C.M.A. No.6118 of 2005 under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. filed by the appellant, in Suit No.952 of 2005, was dismissed.
Briefly stated the appellant is a public limited Company engaged in the business of manufacturing and assembling of motorcycles. The appellant is marketing the motorcycles under the trademark ""Hero"" since 1997. In the year, 2005 the appellant came to know that the respondent had introduced a new motorcycle under the name and style of ""Asiahero"". The appellant was of the opinion that by using the mark Asiahero the said respondent had infringed their exclusive right of using the term HERO and this mark Asiahero would impair their goodwill, which they had acquired in the motorcycle manufacturing industry. According to the appellant the mark Asiahero used by the respondent is capable of attracting clients who would like to buy HERO, which is a well known brand for years and the respondent has adopted this name just to sail close to the appellant and to enjoy the same popularity and goodwill which the appellant had acquired in the last couple of years. In this backdrop the appellant preferred Suit No.952 of 2005 in which an application for injunction, being C.M.A. No.6118 of 2005, was moved. Such application was dismissed vide the above referred impugned order.
 
","Miss Shazia Tasleem Advocate, appeared on behalf of the appellant and submitted that the learned Single Judge was not justified in dismissing the injunction application without considering the fact that the appellant is adopting the trademark HERO since 1997 and in the last? couple of years they had acquired popularity and goodwill. It was further submitted by the learned counsel that the name Asiahero is deceptively similar and an identical trademark to the mark Hero. She has further submitted that the appellant had invested a huge amount towards concept, designing, and advertisements and has therefore earned goodwill in the mark in this regard. She submitted that by using the mark Asiahero the respondent wants to impair the said reputation achieved by the appellant during the last couple of years, hence, the respondent may be restrained from using the said trade name Asiahero, which according to her is quite similar to the trademark of the appellant's and is thus violative of the provisions of the Trademark Ordinance, 2001. Learned counsel for the appellant has further stated that the learned Single Judge has also not taken into consideration the fact that the appellant has filed suits for permanent injunction against the Companies using the trade name ""King Hero/Pak Hero"". In the end she submitted that the learned Single Judge has not appreciated the decisions cited by the appellant before him. The learned counsel has finally prayed that the order passed by the learned Single Judge may be set aside by accepting the appellant's application.
Mr. Munawar Ghani Advocate appeared on behalf of the respondent and submitted that no infringement of the trademark under question has been made by the respondent Company. Learned counsel vociferously submitted that the mark Hero is a word of common parlance and of wide amplitude. He submitted that nobody could be given exclusive right to use the mark Hero as there could be occasions of either prefixing and suffixing any word with the word Hero. Learned counsel also submitted that the mark Asiahero is quite distinct and different from the mark Hero and the learned Single Judge was quite justified in dismissing the application moved by the appellant, which according to him was misconceived. He further submitted that not only the trade name is different but the emblem of HERO also is quite different. Moreover the prices of the two motorcycles also are quite different. The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that there is no sign of deceptive similarity between the two trademarks, as alleged by the appellant. He further submitted that in India also a Company is manufacturing motorcycles under the brand name of ""Hero Honda"". The learned counsel further submitted that the allegation of the appellant that due to similarity of the names of Hero and Asiahero a common person could get confused while purchasing a motorcycle is also misplaced as any person purchasing a motorcycle is fully aware of the produce he wishes to purchase. Learned counsel further submitted that the learned Single Judge has passed an elaborate and erudite order by touching upon each and every aspect of the case. According to him the learned Single Judge has not only elaborately and eloquently thrashed out the facts of the case but has also relied upon a number of precedents in this regard. The learned counsel finally submitted that this appeal is misconceived and may, therefore, be dismissed accordingly.
","In view of the above discussion, we are of the view that this High Court Appeal is misconceived and deserves to be dismissed in limine. These are the detailed reasons in respect of the short order announced by us on 30-9-2009.
However, before parting with the order we would like to observe that since the order only decides an appeal arising from an interlocutory order, the observations and conclusions herein shall not affect the outcome of the pending suits.

","We have heard both the learned counsel at length and find ourselves to be in agreement with the impugned order. The learned Single Judge, in our opinion, has passed an exhaustive and elaborate order, whereby the learned Judge has not only discussed the facts of the case in detail but has also relied upon a number of decisions given by the superior Courts on the issue. In our considered view the appellant has failed to make out any case of interference, since the appellant could not be given the exclusive right of the mark Hero which in our view is a word of common parlance and is used in a number of varieties/cases. We are guided in this regard by the test laid down by the apex Court in Western Brand Tea v. Tapal Tea (Pvt.) Ltd. reported as PLD 2001 SC 14 wherein it was observed as follows:--
 ""It is cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organizations in trading specific commodity.""

The Honourable Supreme Court in Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. 2001 SCMR 967 has held that ""the principle underlying the passing off action is that it is unlawful for a trader to pass off his goods, as the goods of another"".
Being cognizant of the above precedents, suffice would it to say that the word ""HERO"" is otherwise descriptive and is being employed generally across the board. Hence there is prima facie no possibility of any deception being entertained in the minds of the public upon usage of the two competing marks. Moreover, the appellant has also failed to provide any material so as to substantiate any possible deception. To extend any protection to the appellant with regard to its mark ""HERO"" is thus uncalled for.
We also agree with the learned Single Judge that the balance of convenience also tilts in favour of the respondent rather than the appellant for the simple reason that the mark HERO has been employed across the board.

SHOW-CAUSE NOTICES Nos.18 AND 19 OF 2010 issues to Messrs ACE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES: In the matter of
 

","File Nos.3 [REG/COMP/BMW/SEC.10/CCP/09 and 4/REG/COMP/H.D/SEC.10 /CCP/09, decided on 16th August, 2010.",,,"Messrs Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft and Messrs H-D Michigan L.L.C. (hereinafter referred to as 'BMW' and 'HD', respectively; and collectively referred to as the 'Complainants') filed complaints under Section 10 of the Ordinance read with Regulation 17 of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007 alleging that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using Complainants' registered trademarks on its products. It was further alleged that such use of Complainants' trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' and is prohibited in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance. The contents of the complaints are summarized as follows:
That BMW is a Company organized under and existing under the laws of Germany, having its registered office at Petuelring 130, BMW House, 80809 Munich, Germany. That BMW in the year 1917 developed the famous logo of BMW. The idea .of this logo was primarily based on the Circular Design of Aircraft propeller as well as the blue and white segments were reflective of the Bavarian coat of arms. 
That the goods sold and business conducted using trademark, service mark, company name and trade name BMW and BMW Logo throughout the world by BMW have been widely advertised in international magazines, periodicals and news papers which also have circulation in Pakistan and/or most have been seen by the Pakistani public and BMW has spent huge amount of money for this purpose which has resulted in the tremendous awareness of the trademark, trade name, service mark and company name of BMW and BMW Logo which are recognized by the traders and the general public throughout the world including Pakistan as originating and/or having association with BMW or under its authority.
That BMW has authorized Messrs Dewan Farooq Motors Limited, a Pakistani Company as authorized Importers/Dealers/Distributors for its BMW cars in Pakistan. .
That BMW, over a period of time, expanded its range of goods to other allied or related goods as well as large variety of fashion and luxury merchandise, accessories, etc., and in order to distinguish its goods, business and services from those of others, BMW either itself or through its subsidiaries, licensees and/or affiliates uses amongst other BMW as Trademark logo. Businesses and services include; cars, car accessories, automobile parts, motorcycles, bikes, mountain bikes, cruise bikes, kids bikes, bags and various other products such as golf kits, golf balls, golf sticks, wallets, key chains, fountain pens, ball points, umbrellas, locks, clothing, jackets, leather jackets, leather bags, jeans, caps, sport shirts, T-Shirts, cigarette cases and lighters etc.
That HD is an American motorcycle manufacturer. Founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the first decade of the 20th century, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great depression.
That HD also carries on, either itself or through its licensees, affiliates of associated companies, a wide range of manufacturing such as motorcycle, its parts and accessories and other wide range of products including but not limited to motorcycle clothing, motorcycle sports apparels including leather jackets, lifestyles accessories, which are marked using HD's trademarks.
There is no authorized dealer of HD in Pakistan and they have not authorized AGI to use their Trade Mark on its products.
 It has been alleged in the complaint that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using HD's registered trademarks on its products. It has been alleged that such use of HD's trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' in terms of Section 10 (2) (a), (b) & (c) of the Ordinance. HD has also appended the images from the website of AGI. (Annex-A and B to this Order).
","Upon receipt of the complaint, the Commission asked the Complainants' through its counsel, vide its letter dated 9-10-2009 to attend a meeting at the offices of the Commission in Islamabad on 14-10-2009 and to provide the following supporting documents/information within ten days of receipt of the letter:--
 
(i) A copy of authorization to act on behalf of the Complainants',
 
(ii) Certified copies of the Trade Mark Registration Certificates',
 
(iii) Whether any proceedings regarding the captioned matter between the Complainants and AGI have already been decided by any court of law or the Trade Mark Registry or by any other statutory body? If yes, then to provide the Commission with all pleadings and Orders passed thereon;
 
(iv) Whether the Complainants every authorized AGI to manufacture the leather jackets in the past for the Complainants?
 
(v) Details relating to the legal status of AGI;
 
(vi) When and how did it come to the Complainants' knowledge that AGI was allegedly using their trade mark? ;
 
(vii) What other forms of advertisement is AGI using besides advertising the jackets online for sale? ;
 
(viii) Whether the Complainants are aware of any sales made by AGI regarding the products advertised, bearing their trade mark? And to provide any sales receipts or purchase orders, if any, of those sales;
 
(ix) Whether the Complainants are also manufacturing and selling similar products themselves?
","Hence, keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am of the considered view that, deceptive marketing in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance has been carried out by AGI and the fraudulent use of the trademark by AGI was very much capable of harming the business interest of the complainants in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) and (d) of the Ordinance.
Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Ordinance, however, the approach of the representative of AGI needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and even amended their website immediately after receipt of letter from the Commission. In addition to the fact that he admitted the violation of the Ordinance not only at the enquiry stage but also during the course of hearing and cooperated by submitting all the record requisitioned by the Commission and apologizing and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit. I am, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 2,50,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, AGI is reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Ordinance.
In terms of what has been stated above both the Show Cause Notices Nos. 18 and 19 of 2010 issued to AGI are hereby disposed.
 

","The Complainant's counsel vide its letter dated December 21, 2009, provided the Commission with the fax numbers of AGI and also requested that substituted mode of service may please be adopted for serving the complaints to AGI.
The Complaints were again sent through fax and through courier vide letter dated 22-12-2009. This time the Complaints were received by the Respondent both through fax and through courier.
 
AGI vide its letters dated 6-1-2010 filed identical reply to both the Complaints, which reads as follows:
""That the Respondent is neither any incorporated concern nor a registered firm rather a small businessman under sole proprietorship. On initiation of business desirous to have some website and after having got prepared the same it was placed on web.
 
That the Respondent having no knowledge about such type of special laws innocently offered the garments from trade, with no intention to deceive any person in the universe in any manner whatsoever. However, if this hurt the Complainants, I am Sorry for the act and ready to amend the same and change the website accordingly rather has asked for it.""

The enquiry officers after analyzing and examining the Complaints and the above correspondence concluded the enquiry by producing the Enquiry Report dated 17-5-2010 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Enquiry Report""). The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""Though the conduct and attitude of the Respondent may appear to be innocent and ignorant of special laws such as the Ordinance, however, we are inclined with the legal principle that ignorance of law can be of no excuse. Therefore, in view of the above facts, annexures appended herewith, images of the website of the Respondent, and clear admission of the Respondent that, prima facie, there is a violation of Section 10(1) of the Ordinance and in particular clauses (a), (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance, on part of the Respondent.""
At the hearing on 17-6-2010, Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan submitted his analysis of the data provided by AGI and emphasized that the documents did not conform with the statements made at the previous hearing by the representatives of AGI. According to Mr. Khan AGI had a higher turnover than stated by Mr. Tayyab Ali at the first hearing. Mr. Tayyab Ali in response once again apologized and said that he has not lied to the Commission and has correctly stated the facts. He further added that in Sialkot several undertakings are engaged in such practices and they need to be educated through their chamber of commerce that they are in violation of the Ordinance. He filed the undertaking before the Commission admitting the violation of the Ordinance and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit.
Having gone through all the documents available on the record. The main issue which emerges in the matter is whether AGI has engaged itself into the deceptive marketing practices in violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance?
Since, AGI's admission, firstly at the enquiry stage vide its letter dated 6-1-2010 and subsequently vide its undertaking before me on 17-6-2010, leaves no doubt that they were using the trademarks of the Complainants on the images available on their website. During the hearing it was also admitted by AGI that, although they do not have the resources but advertising embellished details such as the capital, staff, tenure of the business always adds to the strength and popularity of the company amongst prospective customers and helps in fetching more orders from abroad. This admission in itself speaks volumes that, the proprietor of AGI although claims to be innocent and ignorant of law, is not that innocent at all. Further the allegations by the Complainant that their logos were used on the website by AGI knowingly that they are famous renowned logos owned by other companies, was never refuted by AGI and although not expressly admitted by the AGI but the statements made by them implies that the trademarks of Complainants' were used owing to their popularity amongst the public at large. The only justification which was afforded by the representatives of AGI was 'ignorance of law'.
During the course of hearing, I was informed by the representatives of AGI that as soon as AGI received letter from the Commission at the enquiry stage they removed all the images containing the registered logos of the complainant and have also amended their website. However, the counsel for the Complainant opposed this and submitted that on the following link the AGI's page showing the image of BMW jacket is still available.
I am least impressed with the justification afforded by AGI for violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance that, they were not aware that 'they were in breach and/or in contravention of any law'. It is pertinent to point out that 'ignorance of law is no excuse' is primarily based on the legal maxims Ignorantia juris non excusat which means ignorance of the law does not excuse or Ignorantia legis neminem excusat which means ignorance of the law excuses no one. The rationale behind these maxims is that if ignorance was an excuse, a person charged with criminal offence or a subject of a civil law suit would merely claim that he/she or it was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even though the person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law imputes knowledge of all laws to all persons within the jurisdiction no matter how transiently, especially to the laws which relates to the business which the person is involved in.
Furthermore, in the matter of Ahmad Bakhsh and 3 others v. Managing Director, (Superintending Engineer) WAPDA Electric Supply Company, Multan, 1995 PLC 536, it was held as follows:
""Nobody, could plead ignorance of provisions of Constitution or any other codified law, because after such law was notified in official Gazette; presumption would be that everybody living in country would have knowledge thereof'
Keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am inclined to hold that, plea of ignorance cannot be accepted as a valid justification or defence, at all. Moreover, the representative of AGI himself admitted that the information provided on the website regarding the establishment of AGI, its staff, its capital and ancillary details are only provided to build a good image and to fetch more orders from abroad, hence any plea of innocence does not seem tenable. In view of this clear intent and objective, it only makes the use of the subject trademarks as fraudulent on part of AGI.
With reference to the allegation that the unauthorized/fraudulent use of Complainant's registered trade marks by AGI is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant in terms of clause (a) subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance read with subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Ordinance.
The Complainants' counsel has submitted documents and copies of the certificate making it clear that the trademarks used by AGI on its website are exclusively owned by the Complainant and the documents available on the record also establish that the logos are well recognized and holds goodwill to themselves and are not only well known in the public at large but are also well recognized.
The documents and evidence available on the record such as the website images and the catalogues submitted by the Complainants establish that they are involved in the manufacturing and sale of the products, which AGI advertised on its website. There is no doubt that, the website of AGI is accessible from any where around the world and the products advertised and offered for sale on AGI's website are same as the ones manufactured and marketed by the Complainants, as well. In presence of the website images of AGI and their admission regarding unauthorized use of trade marks of the Complainant, there is no doubt in reaching to the conclusion that the information disseminated by AGI through its website is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainants with reference to the products advertised therein.

","R.F.A. No.108 of 2000, decided on 30th March, 2009.",,,"Messrs National Tool Industry (Registered), appellant herein instituted a suit before learned District Judge, Rawalpindi under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for permanent injunction and recovery of damages against the respondent. The respondent contested the suit and out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, 7(seven) issues were framed and the evidence of the parties was recorded in response thereto. Learned District Judge, Rawalpindi on conclusion of the trial, vide his judgment and decree dated 9-5-2000, dismissed the writ of the appellant, holding therein that the trade mark used by the defendant is distinct, leaving no similarity with the trade-mark of the respondent. While reaching the said conclusion, it was observed by the learned Court that the appellant has failed to prove that anyone has been deceived by the trademark of the defendant.","Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that tine appellant is a registered proprietor of the trademark vide Serial No.79351 with effect from 2-4-1983. The appellant is selling shovels bearing the trademark of one cancel and falls in the category of Tools and Instruments thrilling part of clause 8 of schedule 2. The defendant's trademark is identical in every respect to that one of the appellant's except that it contains two camels. He has added that Issues Nos.2 to 4 were decided in the impugned judgment in favour of the appellant; plaintiff and the findings of learned trial Court qua issues Nos.1, 5 and 6 were against the plaintiff/appellant which are now assailed in this appeal. Learned Court has failed to ascertain the fact that both the trade marks so merely resemble that there is every likelihood to deceive the customer. He added that when get-up is so close that it can be ascertained, merely on it's cursory look, no evidence of deception is needed. It was argued that in the comparison of trademarks, the Court has to examine and decide the controversy from various angles namely similarity and dissimilarity of trademarks, over all get-up and to find that unwaried purchasers can be deceived in view of close resemblance. The issue of deception can be decided by comparing both the trademarks side by side. Learned counsel submitted that U.W.2, in his cross-examination has admitted that trademark is pasted around the handle of the shovel horizontally. He then submitted that when trademark is pasted around the handle one camel disappears and the other becomes conspicuous. Learned counsel while discussing the evidence has submitted that D.W.1 appeared himself and D.Ws Nos.2 to 4 are the shopkeepers of Mochi Bazar, Rawalpindi. They slated that there was no complaint from the customers that they wanted to purchase the shovel with one camel but the shovel having the trademark of two cancels was sold to them. Learned counsel submitted heat no purchaser was brought to witness box but the sellers who sell the shovels of the defendant/respondent. The witnesses are interested witnesses and their statement cannot be relied upon.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has submitted that the appellant is manufacturing shovel with it's trademark ""single camel"" and the same is registered. While the respondent is manufacturer of shovel carrying the label of ""two camels"". He went further to argue that onus to prove issues Nos.3 to 6 was on the plaintiff who failed to prove the same. P.W. 1 the star witness has not stated anything towards infringement of the trademark. He added that it was a primary responsibility of the appellant to prove infringement of the brand/label. There is remarkable difference between the two brands. The brand of the appellant conspicuously mentioned name of it's manufacturer ""National Tools"" while the brand of the respondent contains the name of it's manufacturer ""Azhar Enterprises"". The buyer, through a glance at the brand name, earl differentiate between the two. Learned counsel while referring to the case of ""Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd."" 1989 SCMR 361 contended that primary test to decide whether a trademark which was owned by another has become publics juris is to sec whether it's use by other persons is still calculated to deceive the public. Learned counsel then contended that where an unwary user is likely to be deceived, is the test wherefrom infringement of the trademark can be ascertained. Mere similarity of competing trademarks is not enough. What has to be adopted is that both the trademarks are so striking that an unwary purchaser would be deceived. Learned counsel in support of his contention has referred to the cases of ""Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another"" PLD 1984 SC 8, ""Insaf Soap Factory v. Lever 13rothers Port Sunlight Ltd."" PLD 1959 (W.P.) Lahore 381 and Bandenawaz Ltd. v. Registrar of Trade Marks. Karachi and another"" PLD 1967 Karachi 492. Learned counsel submitted that trademark should not be placed side try side to land out the similarity. He added that both the brand of trademarks should not be compared side by side as alleged by the appellant but infringement has to be tested while comparing one mark in the absence of outer. He supported his contention from the dictum laid down in the case of 'The Welcome Foundation Limited v. Messers Karachi Chemical Industries (Private) Limited"" 2000 YLR 1376.","The claim of the appellant for damages is permissible only when the damages claimed are asserted in the suit under each head separately and proved through cogent evidence. The appellant has failed to prove damages and his claim has rightly been declined by learned trial Court. Thus, the appeal to this extent is dismissed.
For the foregoing, this appeal is partially allowed, the judgment and decree of learned trial Court qua dismissal of the claim of the appellant for infringement of trademark is set aside, the suit of the plaintiff is decreed for permanent injunction, restraining the respondent from infringing the appellant's registered trademark. Parties are left to bear their own costs.

","Learned counsel for the respondent mainly defended the impugned judgment and decree of learned trial Court on the plea that the infringement of a registered trademark is essentially proved from evidence showing that get up of two trademarks/brands is similar and there is every likelihood of deception by an unwary purchaser. A plaintiff has to lead evidence in this regard and in the absence of such evidence, suit is not liable to be decreed. The contention of learned counsel for the respondent is not convincing. Similarly the observation of the learned Court, is that the plaintiffs failure to produce witness deposing that he fell victim to misunderstanding because of similarity of the trademarks is not well founded. The plaintiff was non-suited on this sole reason/plea, erroneously. Section 21 of the Trade Marks Act, 194.0 is relevant which reads as under:--
 
""21(1) Subject to the provisions of sect ions 22, 23 and 26, the registration of a person in the register as proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trademark or a registered riser thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it. as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either--
(a) as being used as a trade mark; or
(b) to import a reference to some person having the right either as a proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.""
Perusal of the above provision of law reflects that the legislature in it's own wisdom has used the terms ""likely to deceive"" and ""cause confusion"". The term ""likely to deceive"" is wide enough to negate the stance of' the respondent drat absolute proof is needed to make out a case of infringement of trademark. A plaintiff can establish the case of infringement of trademark, by proving that impugned trademark has caused confusion or it so nearly resemble with registered trademark that there is likelihood of it's deception, without calling the witness in the witness box, who was so deceived.
 
Necessity of leading evidence to prove the infringement of trademark came up for consideration before the superior Courts and the issue was examined in the following cases, as under:--
(i) The Privy Council in the case of ""Lever v. Goodwin"" (1887) 36 Ch. D.1) observed that in the matter where there is no evidence that no one has in fact being deceived is immaterial. It is not necessary that there should be evidence that no one in fact had been deceived. It is enough it the plaintiff satisfies the Court that lire defendant's goods marked in the manner so as to lead the purchaser to believe that there being the goods of the plaintiff.
(ii) In the case of ""Messrs Burney's Industrial and Commercial Company Limited v. Rehman"" PLD 1983 Kar.357, Honourable Sindh High Court observed that evidence of an expert witness or an intelligent customer or even a customer of average intelligence who takes ordinary care while buying goods in the market, world not be relevant as the lest is that of an unwary purchaser and it is only the evidence of an unwary purchaser which would be relevant. Learned Court went further and observed that some witnesses for the plaintiff, in a trademark infringement action, may state that they were deceived by the infringing mark whereas other witnesses giving evidence for the defendant may depose to the contrary. It may, therefore, be observed that invariably the Court, alter taking into consideration the two marks, the registered and the infringing, decide whether the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to he deceived.
Survey of above case-law and the provisions of section 21 of the Act, 1940 (now repealed) brings me to conclude that infringement of trademark cannot be proved through bringing the buyers in the witness box. Each side can lead the evidence of it's own choice and pass through the test of cross-examination. The Court can examine the material relevant evidence and two marks and decide that the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to be deceived.
Learned Court has non-suited the plaintiff and dismissed the suit on the solitary ground that no witness was produced in evidence to prove that at the time of purchase he (the witness) was deceived. Learned Court has not only committed material irregularity while reaching this conclusion but has neglected to follow the law settled through various judgments of the superior Courts. The impugned judgment and decree is based on wrong assumption of law and as such it is not sustainable.
Now, I will advert to the instant controversy. On mere examination of both the trademarks, it is evident that colour scheming, border, design and get up, is similar and closely resembled. Normally, in a picture sky is portrayed in blue while soil/ground is shown as green. In the registered trademark, the background is yellow and ground is red with grey strips. The respondent has dishonestly followed the same pattern and used the same colour scheme, opting to make his label identical and similar to that one of the appellant. No doubt that both the labels are worded differently. The label of the appellant comprises of the word ""Improved"" while the respondent's, label carries the words ""'Two Camels"". The address mentioned in the former label is National Tool Industry Chowk Kotli Behramji Sialkot No.3, while Azhar Enterprises Umar Road, Rawalpindi is the address mentioned in the latter label. Lower portion of both the labels is similarly worded. Both the labels comprise three parts and their colour scheming and size create the element of deception. No matter both the labels are examined side by side, or one in the absence of other. The deception becomes more conspicuous when the label is affixed at the handle of the shovel, which is round in shape. If infringing label is fixed at the top of the handle one of the camels becomes invisible and gives impression of one camel instead of two camels. An unwary purchaser in the instant case is whether a farmer or a labourer or an illiterate person, as the tool is meant for this class of users. Such class of purchasers cannot distinguish the label by the English words used therein. They normally purchase the product by device or get up. This aspect cannot be ignored.

The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 opened an LC in April, 2007, started marketing its product 'FOLIQAM Pearl' with distinct trademark, trade name, color scheme, design, calligraphy, and are continuously importing and selling in the market by user for almost one year without any objection from any quarter. Defendants have launched six products, in competition with the plaintiff in respect of only one product. On market search from trademark registry the defendant No.1 had applied for registration of 'FALIQAM' on 28-5-2007, the plaintiff had fraudulently passed the trademark only to create confusion and to cause damage to the reputation and goodwill of the defendants and had launched on small scale 'FOLIQAM' in large pack of 5 pouches under defendant's brand name in market. The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 received notice under section 27 of the Trademark Ordinance 2001 issued in collusion with the plaintiff on the basis of forged and subsequent application for registration of 'FOLIQAM', affidavit in rejoinder was filed by the plaintiff.
","Ms. Iqra Saleem learned counsel for plaintiff has contended that the plaintiffs right has been infringed on account of the acts of the defendants by using the trademark similar to that of the plaintiff thus the crucial question is whether the use of the word 'FOLIQAM' in the trading style of the defendant has infringed the trademark of the plaintiff? Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the use Of the word 'Pearls' by the defendant's in course of their business is an act of infringement of the right in terms of sections 39, 46(2) and (3), 67 of the Trademark Ordinance, 2007 and sections 7 and 8 of the Registered Designs Ordinance XLV of 2000. It came to the knowledge of the plaintiff in the second week of June, 2008 that an identical mark Foliqam Pearls has been marketed and distributed detriment to the plaintiff proprietor and commercial interest in its products by imitating deceptively similar trademark and packing.
Learned counsel for defendant's has contended that defendant No.2 has created its own brand which is distinctive in get up, color scheme, design calligraphy of the plaintiff in following terms:--
 
(i) Attractive and eye catching pack with red and dark pink color dominating.
 
(ii) One big and one small size swans on front and back panels of the box. Objective of this was to create an identity of Foliqam.
 
(iii) Being proud of name Aqmar, we have prominently and boldly written the name Aqmar on all the four panels of the box.
 
(iv) Since Pink is more accepted color by females, we put our best efforts to develop Foliqam soft-gel capsules in pink color. This helped us to claim that our product Foliqam is totally different from the competitor.
 
Learned counsel for defendant's has also pointed out comparison on 'Foliqam' Bottles Pack v. 'FOREVA' Bottle Pack. It is urged that from the cursory look of both the brands there are no similarities and both the brands are quite distinct and it cannot be said that the product is creating deception in the market.
 
","After the examination of the marks labels of both the parties as incorporated in the United Kingdom v. Mehran Bottlers (Private) Limited Karachi PLD 2000 Karachi 192, the well-established principles noted for deciding the question of similarity of the two marks I am of the view that over all similarities the touchstone and after adjudging both from the point of first impression of person of average intelligence the structure label, Phonetic, similarity or dissimilarity and then the wary purchasers should not put in a state of wonder what I am of the view that there is no possibility for an average wary customer to be deceived or confused from a product as the same is imported from the foreign country and both the labels are distinct on account of colour scheme and the variation in the labels of both the parties, therefore, I am not inclined to grant of injunctive relief as claimed by the plaintiff, consequent thereof C.M.A.6872 of 2008 is hereby dismissed.
 

 
","For almost one year the defendants Nos.1 and 2 are continuously using bona fide concurrent use of its products 'Foliqam Pearls' not a single incident of deception has been placed on record by the aggrieved party. The plaintiff was intending to launch 'Foliqam Pearls' in use of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 for the last 10 months within the knowledge of the plaintiff as is established from annexures B-3, B-4, B-5, B-6, B-7, B-8 and B-37 annexed with the counter-affidavit on the back of 'FOREVA PEARLS' has been changed by Matrix in January, 2008 and 'FOREVA PEARLS' is available in pack of 60 each Softgel in blister form. It will not be out of place to mention that the mark of Foliqam is too old., It is being used by the pregnant women of congenital abnormalities, which is sold in the market by many other companies such as Zafar, Nabil, Qasim, Abbot, Agb, Rg, Barbell, Hodgoson and others. It has also been pointed out that softgel capsules are imported by another competitor Forlive in rounded shape in pink colour capsules similar to that used by the defendants Nos.1 and 2 and there is nothing to suggest that the middle line in the capsules code certain right of registration as in all the capsules as middle lines are used to fill as a common features.
 
It has also revealed that the products of both the parties have not been registered under trademark registry and the applications are pending, thus the only question involved is in respect of passing off the products clothed with mis representation coupled with damages and goodwill. Much of the emphasis has been placed on unreported order passed in case of Messrs Hero Motor Ltd. by a Single Bench of this Court in Suit No.952 of 2005, in case of Bayer A.G. and another v. Macter International (Pvt.) Ltd. 2003 CLC 794; adverting to the question of deception of question as to mark used by the defendants while determining the Test Phonetic similarity of trade name of pharmaceutical product. Generic name of a pharmaceutical product could not function as a trade name to indicate its origin, points to be considered by Court in arriving at the conclusion of fact as to whether deception or confusion was likely to be caused enumerated. Whether the defendants are selling the goods so marked by design calculated to lead the public to believe that they' are the plaintiffs goods. It has further been observed as under:--
""The ultimate test is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff. The court has to compare the two marks with the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standard. The persons, who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject for consideration. The purpose of comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiffs trademark are to be found used by the defendant. When two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles with the plaintiffs registered trade mark that it is likely to deceive to cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which it is registered.""
That above rule would be applicable in judging the case of infringement but while dealing with the cases of drugs sold on prescription by the doctors, chemists and druggists, these factors assume much significance.
So far as the question of the deception and confusion created in the minds of the general public is concerned besides the packing, logo and label, prima facie, it is required to be judged with similarity has affected the business of the parties marketing the drugs, not a single instance has been produced c to substantiate that with the use of product any loss has been caused to the plaintiffs business. It is not the plaintiffs case that he had sustained any loss due to the use of the similar product in the market with colour and scheme design and calligraphy marked by the defendant. This issue came up for hearing before Division Bench of this Court in High Court Appeal No.248 of 2006 for the use of the Trade Mark 'Master'. It was observed that the 'Master' is public juris owned by the public and not by a private person and when a thing is a private property anyone can make use of it as held in cases of 1987 CLC 1448, Multani Sohan Halva, Hussain Aghahi Multan v. Registrar of Trademarks, Karachi and another 2001 SCMR 967, Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others. The plaintiff has emphasized much on the word 'Pearls' which is commonly used throughout the world. The label and the bottle used by the defendant is strikingly different with dominating features and brightly coloured therefore it will not effect the mind of the public and would not cause loss to the business word goodwill of the plaintiff.",M.B.A./S-66/K Application dismissed.,Dismissed

","Suit No.983 and C.M.A. No.6910 of 2007, decided on 2nd November, 2007.",,,"By this application the plaintiffs has prayed that defendant may be restrained from copying and/or applying the plaintiffs Registered designs namely 11357-D, 12310-D, 12311-D, 12312-D, 12328-D and 12329-D and plaintiff No.2's registered trademark No.187121 dated 19th July, 2003 namely ""BODYCAP"" and from making, importing, selling, hiring, offering to sell or hire or working articles bearing or embodying a design and/or trademark which, is a copy of the said registered designs.
 
The facts 'necessary for disposal of the application are that tilt plaintiff No.1 is the registered proprietor of above mentioned designs registered under Designs Ordinance XLV of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the registered designs) and the fibre canopies manufactured as per these designs are sold by the plaintiffs under the trademark "" BODYCAP"" duly registered in the name of plaintiff No.2. It. is alleged that the defendant is imitating the said designs and. applying the same to the canopies it manufactures, and sells.
","The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submit that the plaintiffs' are the registered proprietors of the designs and trademark and have the exclusive right to use the said designs and trademark and the defendant by using the said designs and trademark violating their exclusive, rights. He further submits that the canopies made by.. the defendant"" are similar to the canopies manufactured by the plaintiff and submits that for claiming infringement of registered designs it is not necessary that the imitation are substantially similar with the registered designs. The learned counsel has referred to the photographs of the registered designs as well as the photographs of the canopies manufactured by the defendant and submits that from looking two canopies it is established that they are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. ","For the above reason the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case in his favour and the balance of convenience is also in their favour and in case the injunction is not granted they will suffer irreparable loss and will be deprived from the benefits of the registered designs.
 
In view of the above the application is allowed as prayed with no order as to costs.

","The plaintiffs by filing the photocopies of the certificates for registration of designs and certificate of Registration of Trademark ""BODYCAP"" established their right to exclusively use the design and trademark. The plaintiff by filing the photographs of the canopies manufactured by it and by the defendant has also established that both are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. The defendant by not filing his reply has failed to rebut the above factual controversy.
 
Subsection (2) of section 7 of the Registered Design Ordinance provides that the owner of a registered design shall have right to exclude third parties, not having his consent, from making, selling or working articles or embodying a design which is a copy of the registered design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purpose.
 
The plaintiff No.1 being the Registered Proprietor of the designs mentioned above is entitled to exclusively use the same and defendant without his consent have no right to copy the same.
 
Section 8 of the Ordinance deals with infringement. Subsection (1) of section 8 provides that if any person infringes a registered proprietor's right, the registered proprietor may bring a suit against him for the recovery of damages and for an injunction against the continuation of the infringement. Provided that for the purpose of grant of a temporary injunction, the registered proprietor must show that he has a prima facie case and that his design is valid and that it has been infringed by the defendant.
 
The design of the defendant is almost similar to the registered designs of the plaintiffs and the Registered designs of plaintiff No. 1 are still valid.
 
In the unreported case of Messrs Team Nayyer (Pvt.) Limited v. Kamran Jamal Khan (Suit No.495 of 2007) authored by my learned brother Mushir Alam, J. it was held as under:
 
""After hearing the Federal counsel I have observed that there is apparently strong resemblance on both the canopies of the plaintiff and defendant and minor difference pointed out by the defendant, which are still subject to objection, cannot make much difference to remove the deception in respect to recognition as to whether both canopies are from one designer or not. The Registrar of design is also of the view that canopy of the plaintiff is registered with design No.12310-D while the design applied for by the defendant was refused.""
 
For claiming infringement it is not necessary that the two designs are similar to each other in all respect. Resemblance in two designs are sufficient to establish infringement. In this case the plaintiff prima facie established that the design of the defendant resembled with the registered designs of the plaintiff and is capable of creating confusion and deception.","

Messrs ANWAR INDUSTRIES (PVT.) LTD. Through Chief Executive and another---Respondents
 

 
","F.A.O. No. 158 of 2005, decided on 28th February, 2007.",,,"The appellant through the instant appeal has assailed the order of the Additional District Judge/Trial Court dated 27-5-2005 whereby, he accepted the application of respondent No.1 for grant of temporary injunction.
The facts giving rise to the present appeal are that respondent No.1 filed a suit for permanent injunction against the appellant and respondent No.2, under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 prayed for restraining defendants from infringing the registered trade mark and property mark ""Asia"" of respondent No.1/plaintiff. The suit was accompanied by an application for temporary injunction. The appellant contested the suit and filed written statement as well as reply to application for temporary injunction. Learned trial Court after hearing the parties proceeded to accept the application for temporary injunction, resultantly appellant No.1 was restrained from using the trade mark of ""Asia"" by adding word ""Super"" in the inner stage. Appellant was also restrained from manufacturing all items including the fans in the name and style of ""Super Asia"". Respondent No.2 was restrained from selling the items, manufactured by appellant No.1. Hence, this appeal assailing the order of the trial Court.
","Learned counsel for the appellant at the very outset has submitted that the respondents herein opposed the registration of trade mark of the appellants ""Super Asia"" in the earlier litigation, on the identical grounds, which are now subject-matter of suit. The moot question 'whether or not the trade mark ""Super Asia"" resemble with that of respondents' trade mark ""Asia"" remained under consideration in previous litigation. It was held after comparing both ""trade marks that both trade marks are different. The findings/orders of this Court dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.199 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. M/s Mohd Din and Sons), established that the plaintiff/respondent has no prima facie case. As per provisions of Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 the decision of this Court was binding on subordinate Courts but this legal aspect was totally ignored by the learned trial Court. Learned counsel then submitted that the registered trade mark of the respondent is subject to disclaimer, which fact is evident from the perusal of registration. Learned counsel went on to argue that the word ""Asia"" being geographical name cannot be registered. Registration of trade mark of the respondent violates the provisions of sections 6 and 13 of Trade Marks Act, 1940. Learned counsel has referred to the case of Anwar Industries Limited v. Muhammad Ishaque Gondal and others (1988 CLC 489) to contend that the trade mark of the respondent, could not be allowed to monopolize a common geographical name ""Asia"". Learned counsel has submitted that the appellant's enterprise being much bigger in size, prior in business and manufacturer of a large number of products as compared to that one of the respondent, cannot be restrained from using its trade mark. He lastly summed up his assertions by submitting that while passing the impugned order learned trial Court has neglected these factors, which were essential to weigh the balance of convenience and irreparable loss.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has fully supported the impugned order. Learned counsel has submitted that the respondent is registered proprietor of Trade Mark ""Asia"" since 23-6-1965. The trade mark of appellant qua the fans is black capsulated spot on white and green background with the word ""Asia"" on it. The registered trade mark of the appellant under the name of ""Super Asia"" does not pertain to fan, it relates to manufacture of goods, other than fans. Learned counsel has submitted that order dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 finds no mention in the written statement and as such cannot be considered in the case in hand. Case of Ehtesham ud Din Qureshi v. Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation Ltd. and others (2004 MLD 361) was referred to 'support this contention. Learned counsel while discussing the scope, extent and infringement of trade mark has referred to the cases of Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others (2001 SCMR 967), Messrs Tabaq Resturant v. Messrs Tabaq Resturant (1987 SCMR 1090) and Unilever PLC v. Al-Alameen Industries (2003 CLD 623). Learned counsel has referred to the cases of M. Sikandar Sultan v. Masih Ahmad Sheikh (2003 CLD 26), Telebrands Corporation through Attorney v. Telebrands Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2006 CLD 580) and Khawaja Tahir Jamal v. Messrs A.R. Fehman Glass (2005 CLD 1768). With reference to case-law, referred, it was contended that the registration of trade mark is meant for the benefit of trader and to protect the public to be mislead or deceived, and for free enjoyment right of manufacturing and marketing products. Learned counsel lastly contended that though the trade mark of the respondent is registered subject to disclaimer yet the registered proprietor can claim monopoly in the manner in which such mark, device, word or combination was put to use. Learned counsel supported his contention by citing case of Pakistan Energy House (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Rio Chemical Company and another (2003 CLD 1531).
 
","For the foregoing, this appeal is allowed and order of the learned trial Court dated 27-5-2005 is set aside, resultantly, the application for grant of temporary injunction, filed by. the respondent, is dismissed. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial at its own merit.
Before parting with the judgment it is clarified that any observation made herein is tentative and not final, yet inevitable.
 
Office is directed to send back the record of the trial Court.
 

","The appeal, in hand, is directed against the order whereby learned trial Court accepted the application of the plaintiff/respondent and granted the relief of temporary injunction. Comparison of trade mark of the appellant with trade mark of the respondent, at this stage, would unfairly prejudice the case of either party before the trial Court. It is yet inevitable to discuss whether or not, the trade mark registered in favour of the respondent, is being infringed or the trade mark used by the appellant is deceptive, earlier decision of this Court, passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. Muhammad Din and sons) is necessary. Relevant part of judgment is reproduced hereunder:--
 
'...Respondent 1's trade mark bearing the words 'Super Asia' has device of oval embellishment in yellow, black and red colours whereas the appellant's trade mark of 'Asia' has device of dental wheel and has different colour scheme. The goods covered by the two sets of trade marks are altogether different and belong to different classes. Respondent 1 has been using the trade mark 'Super Asia' since 1976 and doing quite a good amount of business. The two trade marks are not confusing and are distinguishable. In the circumstances the Registrar had valid reason to turn down the appellant's opposition....""
 
The above judgment/order had not been assailed, before the apex Court, it has attained finality. The decision being inter se the same parties, subject-matter was substantially the same and it was decided by the Court of competent jurisdiction, after hearing the parties. Such decision/judgment in a subsequent suit is binding. It was relevant and most apt for present controversy but was surprisingly ignored by the trial Court. The appellant though has not mentioned about it in written statement, yet has not taken any contrary plea. Above referred judgment of this Court was not taken a plea in defence. Mere non-mention of earlier litigation, in written statement creates no bar. A judgment of High Court is authority, in subsequent suit, which has to be considered and is not liable to be ignored. Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 can be referred in this respect. The impugned order of trial Court whereby earlier order dated 26-10-1986 has not been taken into consideration, is not legally sustainable.
In view of definite finding of this Court that respective trade marks of the parties herein, are altogether different, not confusing and distinguishable, leaves no room to conclude that the pre-requisite of injunction order i.e. prima facie case, was lacking.
 
A bare reading of section 13, clearly reveals that disclaimers are imposed for the purpose of defining the right, under the registration and not otherwise i.e. outside the registration. The proviso clearly provides that rights in a trade mark or a part of a trademark, arise, out of registration of which a disclaimer is made. Registrar at the time of granting of the registration, registered the trademark of the respondent subject to disclaimer, considering that it was not distinctive in favour of the proprietor. It is clear from the reading of section 13 .that the Registrar is empowered to place limitations by way of disclaimers on the rights which are granted to a party applying for registration of a trademark. Disclaimers are necessary to define the rights that a proprietor acquires by virtue of the registration. The disclaimer does not affect the proprietary rights acquired in the disclaimed feature by virtue of use and 'therefore the proprietor can prevent unauthorized use of disclaimed feature by proving prior use and acquisition of reputation and goodwill. One who opposes the exclusive rights of a proprietor in the disclaimed features of trademark, either arising out of a registration or through use must, establish a higher degree of honesty of adoption of that mark by him, absence of bad faith and that the said mark is not a mark itself but only a description of goods or services which is common to trade and should be for free of use by all the traders.
 
Section 6(1)(d) prohibits registration of a trademark comprising of a geographical name. Upon review of the Trade Marks Act as a whole, it becomes apparent that the Trade Marks Act in section 6, lays down the ""distinctiveness requisite for registration"". Therefore any trademark, which does not fulfil the requirements laid down in section 6 is not considered to be inherently distinctive and therefore not registerable. It was perhaps due to the fact that Registrar considered ""ASIA"" to be a geographical name, being the name of a continent, that it was not considered to be distinctive when it was registered and therefore a disclaimer on the exclusive use of the word 'ASIA' was imposed.
 
An important point, which cannot be ignored in these proceedings is that the respondent remained aware of the use of the trade mark 'Super Asia' by the appellant, since at least the year 1993 and they had already unsuccessfully opposed the registration of 'Super Asia' in favour of the appellant. Respondent's appeal before a learned Single Judge of this Court failed and they did not assail that decision before the apex Court. On the other hand, the legal proceedings, out of which this appeal has arisen, were instituted by the respondents against the appellant in the year 2004. There is an unexplained long delay of 11 years in instituting proceedings for infringement and/or passing off against the appellant. Such unexplained delay clearly tilts the balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable loss in favour of the appellant disentitling the respondent for the grant of discretionary relief of interlocutory injunction and these important aspects have been over-looked by the learned Court below.

(6) The cost of the suit may kindly be awarded.
 
(7) Any further relief, this Court deems just and equitable may also be granted.
 
The plaintiff claims to be a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance 1984. It has been pleaded that the l plaintiff is member of prestigious ""DEWAN MUSHTAQ GROUP"" one of the leading; reputed and most prominent groups in Pakistan and has an annual turnover exceeding Pak Rupees 20 billions. The plaintiff has further, pleaded that their main fields of business include textiles, sugar, polyester and acrylic staple fibre, assembly-sum-progressive manufacture of automobiles, Equity participation in a private bank, foods and fast moving consumer goods and other allied business. The plaintiff claims that since 1916 the Dewan Mushtaq Group was set up and in 1947 the Dewan Family migrated in Pakistan: Somewhere in 1999, the plaintiff claims to have got registered their trade lame/trade mark ""Dewan"" under Trade Marks Act 1940. It is further claimed by the plaintiff that plaintiff has also been registered under different classifications in Class-1 to Class-45 inclusive of Class-16, which pertains to item news. letters and 'newspapers'.
","It has been contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that in the face of these documents which includes registration under Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, the defendants have no lawful right to undertake any publication in. 1 he trademark of ""DEWAN"" which is registered trademark of the plaintiff. According to the learned counsel for the plaintiff that section 40(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001 protects the rights of the plaintiffs, and the defendants who are running the newspaper in the name of Daily ""DEWAN"" are debarred to undertake publication in such trademark, as such an act of the defendants infringes the rights of the plaintiff guaranteed under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001.
 
It was further contended that distinct nature of business has hardly any role in the use of the registered trademark of the 1 plaintiff. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001 which is the corresponding section of 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940. In support of her contention, the learned counsel has relied upon the case of Alpha Sewing Machine v: Registrar of Trade Marks reported in PLD 1990 SC Page 1074. 'The learned counsel has submitted that the Honourable Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has held that if there is element of deception or confusion then any such element in respect of nature of business the registered trademark cannot be used by the other party.
 
As against this the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has submitted that the defendants have not undertaken any manufacturing business, but are publishing newspaper which is distinct business and law does not restrict them from using such name. He further submits that the defendants have been granted declaration by the Federal Government to publish daily ""DEWAN"" and this declaration has been endorsed by the DCO, City District Government, Karachi. He therefore, submits irrespective of the registered trademark (DEWAN) of the plaintiff, they can undertake the business of publication in the lame of daily 'Dewan'.
","Under these circumstances I am of the considered view that the plaintiff prima facie had made out a case for grant of .injunction and allowing to use the trade mark ""DEWAN"" by the defendants would cause inconvenience and would lead to deception and confusion in terms of the provision of section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. The balance of convenience also rests with the plaintiff for the purpose of granting of injunction, I therefore, allow this injunction application, restraining the defendants from using the trade name/trademark word DEWAN "" "" in their publication.
 
","Class 16 of the International Classification of goods and services clearly provides that if trademark is registered the same cannot be used by any other person in the face of the provision of section 40(4) read with section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Mere granting of declaration under the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance 2002 does not authorise the defendants to infringe, the right of the plaintiff guaranteed under the provision of the registered. Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The scope of granting of declaration is independent of the provision of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Grant of declaration sloes not give rise to a party a right to use the registered trade mark of another party under the garb of distinct nature of business. The learned counsel for the defendant has failed to cite any case-law in support of his contention to show that publication of the newspaper under the provision of Press Council of. Pakistan Ordinance, 2002 on the basis of a declaration does not excludes the right of .infringement of the plaintiff under the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001.
 
The contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff appeals to reason. Once a trade mark/trade is registered under the provision of Trade Mark Ordinance 2001 then it restricts the other party from using such trademark. Moreso when it is g distinct and use of it would lead to confusion or deception. The agreement, of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is weighty and the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court on the issue also supports the case in hand.

Clause 2 of the agreement was incorporated to provide that Pepsi Cola Company will sell either directly or through its subsidiaries to Bolan Bottlers and the latter will purchase all units of Pepsi Cola concentrate required for the manufacture of the beverage known as Pepsi Cola the world over. A Unit of Pepsi Cola concentrate was of fixed quantity while the price thereof was US $ 1150.
 
Such bottling appointment issued on 26 6 1993 was intact when Pepsi Cola Company, vide letter dated 7 12 1998, cancelled the exclusive bottling appointment. On 16 12 1998, Bolan Bottlers filed a civil suit against Pepsi Cola Company and its various divisions for a declaration to the effect that the cancellation was void and unlawful and further that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and hence it could not be revoked unilaterally by Pepsi Cola Company. An injunction was also sought against Pepsi Cola Company to the effect, inter alia, that Bolan Bottlers be allowed to continue the business and Pepsi Cola Company be restrained from taking any action against the bottlers and under the Trade Marks Act, till the final decision of the suit. As the agreement stood already cancelled; we would better comprehend it to be a temporary mandatory injunction. In the alternative, Bolan Bottlers claimed a sum of Rs.985 million as damages with the assertion that the exclusive bottling appointment stood automatically renewed for another period of five years with effect from 26 6 1998.

The suit was strongly opposed by Pepsi Cola Company calling it to be counterblast to their suit before the High Court of Sindh and seriously alleging that Bolan Bottlers had been guilty of grave violation of terms of appointment and that under the terms thereof the cancellation was but unavoidable. The application filed by the plaintiff under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 read with section 151, C.P.C. was strongly resisted. The learned trial Court, vide its order dated 20 4 1999, allowed the application and granted all the interim reliefs contained in the application. Being aggrieved of the aforesaid order, Pepsi Cola Company filed F.A.O. No. 122 of 1999, whereupon an Hon'ble Single Judge of Lahore High Court recalled the interim injunction through order dated 11 10 1999 and hence Bolan Bottlers filed a petition for leave to appeal, which was granted by this Court on 20 10 1999 to consider various aspects of the case specially that the High Court while recalling the interim injunction, whether or not had complied with the law laid down by this Court in Muhammad Aref Effendi v. Egypt Air 1980 SCMR 588, and whether an injunction in such like cases can be granted, even, when the plaintiff has laid down substantial money claim in shape of damages.
 

","Mr. Tariq Mehmood, learned counsel for the appellant while describing the agreement between the parties as ""franchise"" based his case on three fold grounds. Firstly, that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and therefore, the contract could not be revoked unilaterally under section 202 of the Contract Act. Secondly, that the grounds of cancellation were frivolous and no notice of revocation had been issued. Thirdly, that the duration of agreement had stood automatically extended to ten years before which the cancellation could not be made. A judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No.518 of 1994 (Beecham's case) decided on 7 8 2000 was placed reliance upon. A perusal of the judgment would indicate that the point of law settled therein was, as to, whether clause 12 of the agreement was governed by clause 13 of the agreement or vice versa. The case was argued from another angle as well. Learned counsel for the respondent Company laid sufficient stress on the fact that the Company has already revoked the agreement and stopped the sale of concentrate to Bolan Bottlers. That if any temporary injunction is granted now in their favour, it would amount to a mandate whereby such revoked contract would be trusted upon the respondent. . Our attention has been invited to another important aspect of the case not adequately rebutted by the opposite side. Learned counsel for the respondent has referred to various tests conducted qua the product sold in the market. It was put to four different tests whereafter it transpired that the Bottlers have been using the concentrate of `RC Cola' and were selling it under the name, style and trademark of `Pepsi Cola'. This is alleged to be a serious violation of the trademark in selling a product available for half the price of Pepsi Cola. 
Learned counsel for the appellant seriously objected to the manner in which various samples of the product were procured and sent to the laboratory. He was of the view that a spurious product in the market could have been manufactured by any other violator of the trade mark in the market and hence the availability of a spurious Pepsi Cola cannot be an exclusive prove of the fact that it was produced by Bolan Bottlers. ","Consequent upon what has been discussed above, there being no merit in the appeal, it is hereby dismissed, the order of the High Court is maintained and the temporary injunction prayed for by the appellant/ plaintiff is hereby refused.
 

 
","As franchise is not defined in our own Contract Act, we may have a reference to Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition page 658, where franchise is defined as ""a privilege granted or sold, such as to use a name or to sell products or service. The right given by a manufacturer or supplier to a retailer to use his product and name on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon."" In its simplest terms, a franchise is a licence from owner of trademark or trade-name permitting another to sell a product or to serve under that name or mark. Precisely this definition is more akin to a licence rather than an agency. What exists between the present parties is more suitable to be determined in the light of the agreement itself and then the relevant laws on the subject.
 
From the perusal of the agreement in question dated 26 6 1993 (pages 162 to 172) it would be clear that the very heading given to the agreement was neither licence nor agency but it was captioned as ""Exclusive Bottling Appointment"". Though the headings or the captions cannot exclusively determine the nature of a contract yet the various clauses thereof would be material in determining the real nature of the agreement. It would not be convenient to reproduce the entire agreement yet the material clauses thereof would be referred to at the appropriate places. Clause 2 defines the role of the parties where Bolan Bottlers is a purchaser of Pepsi Cola concentrate while  Pepsi Cola Company is the seller thereof. Clause 3 of the agreement further lays down that the trademark shall be the exclusive property of Pepsi Cola Company not subject to question by the Bottler. The seller shall protect the trademark and shall not be liable to the Bottler for any loss or damage suffered by Bottler's use of the trademark. This indicates beyond doubt that in this agreement the Bolan Bottlers would have no right or interest in the trademark or in the registration thereof or any designs, copy rights, patents etc. mentioned above.
Section 211 of the Contract Act describes the agent's duty in conducting the principal's business. Whether the business agreed upon between the parties before us is the one of the principal or of the agent remains to be determined in the light of the agreement. According to the agreement, the entire business belongs to the Bolan Bottlers and not the Pepsi Cola Company. In terms of the provisions of section 182 and 211 of the Contract Act, we believe that, prima facie, the agreement between the parties does not constitute an agency either. In the instant case Bolan Bottlers, as per agreement, is not bound to render any account to Pepsi Cola Company on demand. Section 216 of the Contract Act explains the principal's right to benefit gained by agent dealing on his own account in business of agency. Sections 217 and 218 of the Contract Act also lay down certain conditions that the agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account. In case before us, the Bolan Bottlers never received from the third persons any amount or account on behalf of or for the Pepsi Cola Company. The agreement viewed in the light of the text law, prima facie, indicates the existence of no agency.

We hold in the light of the above discussion, that an agent is a hyphen that joins and a buckle that binds the relation between the principal and the third party. Where a person is not liable to the principal for the submission of accounts such person cannot be dubbed as agent. In the instant case, the product known as Pepsi Cola is sold to the third party as the  property of Bolan Bottlers without any control of Pepsi Cola Company and hence it prima facie lacks the necessary ingredients of an agency. The Bolan Bottlers also do not receive any commission for the sale, rather, they receive the entire amount of sale consideration as well as the profits. 
The first portion of the section is clearly indicative of the fact that either the agent must have an interest pre existing in the property or creation of such interest should be the direct result of the agreement itself. In the instant case, the interest of the parties is only to the extent of sale by one and purchase by the other. Everything comes to an end the moment the sale is completed. The case of the appellant is that after such agreement the Bolan Bottlers constructed offices, employed numerous persons and hence a clear interest was created. This, we are afraid, all the infrastructure which has been constructed and prepared by the appellant is for the promotion of his own business which he commenced in order only to earn his own profits which are never to be shared by the respondent i.e. the Pepsi Cola Company.
After having gone through the law on the subject, we are of the view that only that agency is irrevocable which is created with adequate consideration and is designed to serve as security for some interest of the agent. Any expenditure in setting up office and necessary infrastructure for carrying on business of agency does not tantamount to the creation of interest of agent in the subject matter. To elaborate, we may mention that creation of tenancy or the grant of lease is tantamount to the creation of agency because a tenant or lessee by virtue of the very agreement of lease or tenancy becomes directly interested in the subject matter of lease etc. The interest of a person is created only where the authority is given for the purpose of being a security or is a part of the security and not to cases where such authority is independent and the interest of donee is created afterwards and incidental to the factum of sale etc. An act, of sale of consumer goods does not create an authority coupled with interest. We hold in view of the law coupled with the terms of agreement before us that it does not create an interest of the purchaser by itself and hence prima facie the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted. 
We also believe and hold that in the circumstances of the present case and in the light of section 21(a) read with section 56(f) of the Specific Relief Act, the instant one is not a fit case for the grant of temporary injunction. 
In order to reinforce the argument the learned counsel referred us to .numerous pages of Papers Book V showing the graph of sale of Pepsi Cola concentrate having been purchased by Bolan Bottlers during previous years. This background of sale of concentrate has remained reasonable and constant during early years but for six months next before the institution of suit no concentrate has at all been purchased, whereas, the product is constantly being sold in the market. It is not known as to how could the product be marketed, if genuine, when no concentrate at all is purchased. The obvious conclusion, 'prima facie, would be that some spurious product is marketed and the same is accepted as well in few of dispatches on record. In these circumstances, if a temporary injunction is granted, what assurance would there be that no spurious or unhygienic material shall be sold during the existence of the injunction. It is a case where, by sale of spurious goods, a serious infringement of trademark is alleged along with the substandard quality thereof. All these matters are most likely to adversely affect the goodwill of the Pepsi Cola Company which is always considered to be irreparable. Taking all the ingredients for the issuance of a temporary injunction we believe at this stage that the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted and hence the appellant has no prima facie case. The irreparable loss in case of grant of injunction, in the circumstances, would be that of the Company and not the Bottlers'. While parting with this aspect of the case, we may remark that, so far as the trademark is concerned, the Bottler has neither claimed any interest therein nor could it be so claimed in view of the express provisions of the contract.
Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant claimed that the ad interim injunction, in the instant case is continuing for a long time since, 1999 and that it would not be in the interest of justice if the same is withdrawn now at this stage. This, in our view is a novel argument. When once the High Court had refused injunction, the case should either have been heard by this Court at the most earliest or ad interim injunction should have been made conditional to early hearing. The injunction was originally granted with direction that the case be heard at the earliest possible. In view of the important nature of the case, the magnitude of the stakes and the quantum of finances involved the continuation of ad interim injunction for such a long time, in the circumstances, was rather sad. The appellant should better be not allowed to benefit from a situation so created. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly argued in rebuttal that this contract was created in the gear 1993 and was terminated in the year 1998 but still, under the force of an ad interim injunction, the appellant is in complete enjoyment of the business not sanctioned and desired by the Pepsi Cola Company.",M.B.A/ B 13/S Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

","High Court Appeal No. 170 of 2003, decided on 18th May, 2004.",,,"Through these proceedings, the appellants have impugned order dated 23-5-2004 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.677 of 2001, filed by the respondent, allowing the injunction application of the respondent observing therein that the respondent in terms of section 21 of the Trade Marks Act have right to use the Trade Mark which is subject-matter of this appeal, to the exclusion of the appellants.
The facts, as it appear from the pleadings of the parties are that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court for infringement of trade mark, passing off, perpetual injunction, rendition of accounts and damages against the appellants. Alongwith the suit, the respondent made an application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. praying therein that the appellants be restrained from infringing the alleged trade mark and from passing off the goods. It appears that the matter was contested by the parties before the learned Single Judge who by his order, impugned in these proceedings, had allowed the application of the respondent restraining the appellants from infringing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, supplying, distributing or otherwise passing off the goods under the alleged trade mark `ALETRIS CORDIAL'.
","Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the impugned order is bad in law and has failed to take notices' of the facts in its true perspective. He has further argued that the respondent had no prima facie case and were not entitled to the grant of injunction. According to the learned counsel once title in question of the trademark of a party was in dispute, the Court would riot grant injunction in favour of such a party. 
As against this, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge.","We fully endorse the findings of the Honourable Single Judge given in the impugned order while granting injunction. This Appeal is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs. However, office is directed to fix Suit No.677 of 2001 for settlement of issues within fifteen days and after the issues are settled the matter be listed for evidence, out of turn within 3 months after framing of issues.
 

 
","From the pleadings of the parties it appears that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court against the appellants claiming to be a Private Limited Company doing its business of medicines since 1948. In the plaint, the respondent has pleaded that besides the other, medicines of various brands, which the respondent was manufacturing and selling, the respondent claims to be registered proprietor of trade mark ""ALTERIS CORDIAL'. The respondent subsequently applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks to enter its name in the Register of Trade mark as subsequent proprietor of the said trade mark, which application was allowed and the respondent became subsequent proprietor of the trade mark. According to the respondent the homeopathic medicine by the name of `ALETRIS CORDIAL' under the said trade mark on the device of the bottle in the hand, with distinctive, get up, design and yellow and black colour scheme, due to its high quality gained popularity and was in great demand and, therefore, the respondent got valuable reputation and goodwill in respect of the said medicine in the market.
 
In the year 1998 the respondent came to know that the appellant No. 1 had applied and got registered the label of the respondent said registered trademark in the office of Registrar of Copyright as artistic copyright work label created by him. The respondent made an application for rectification under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, before the Board which application was allowed against which the appellants preferred an appeal which appeal is pending in the Lahore High Court. According to the respondent the appellant No. 1 is manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale his spurious medicine in the trade mark registered in the name of the respondent with the same colour, scheme, get up, design and style. The respondent has disputed the ownership of the Trade mark of the appellant No.1. The appellants in rebuttal filed Counter-Affidavit and Written Statement. It appears that the Honourable Single Judge heard the matter at length and thereafter has passed the impugned order with detail reasons.
 
The impugned order has been passed on an interlocutory application and the learned counsel for the appellants had argued that the grant of injunction when the damages were also claimed, ex-facie was erroneous order. If such an argument is accepted, the usurping of goodwill of the trade mark by the appellants who, prima facie, have no right under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, would be unjust as has been held in the case of TAPAL Tea (Private) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Company reported in 2002 CLD 1113. Pendency of proceedings in appeal preferred by the appellants against the order of the Board, is hardly a ground restricting the Court from granting injunction if a party was otherwise, entitled to such an injunction. Even otherwise, a person, prima facie, having no legal right, guaranteed in law, could not be allowed to continue his business in the face of the reasons advanced by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order. The impugned order has been passed on the material placed before the Honourable Single Judge and we find no reason to upset it. However, the appellants are at liberty to lead evidence to establish their legal right to do the business. The Honourable Single Judge has already observed in the impugned order that his findings were tentative in nature and is subject to evidence, which the parties may lead in support of their pleas. Even observations in the impugned order were held to be tentative and would not prejudice either party before the Registrar, Trade marks or before any forum.",S.A.K./R-11/K Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

Suit No.89 of 2004, decided on 4th June, 2004.
 ",,,"The case of the plaintiff as disclosed in the plaint as well as in the affidavit in support of the application for grant of injunction and the counter-affidavit to C.M.A. No.726 of 2004 is that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to sell her goods/scented sweet supari/Pan Masala etc., under the trademark TASTY and had been selling such item since 1979. Initially such trademark was registered in the name of Hajiani Marium Bai from whom the plaintiff has purchased this business and the said trademark. In order to protect the exclusive proprietary right in respect of trademark TASTY the plaintiff has obtained registration of the said trademark under No.72151 in Class-30 in respect of ""supari"" etc. and the said registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes since 12-7-1980. In order to secure proprietary right the plaintiff has also obtained registration under Copyright Ordinance, 1962 on 23rd April, 1999, and has been using and applying the said trademark in the course of trade in a very peculiar, distinctive and distinguishing label design having colour scheme, design, livery and/or get-up. In the year 1986 plaintiff adopted trademark GOLD for her high quality sweet supari and trademark GOLD is being used by the plaintiff in conjunction with the house mark TASTY in a very peculiar manner in the form of a wrapper/packaging with distinctive colour scheme, design, get-up and livery (hereinafter referred to as ""Tasty GOLD""). The plaintiff has claimed that by virtue of said long use extensive and exclusive quality production she has acquired valuable reputation and goodwill and the goods manufactured by the plaintiff under the trademark and copyrighted ""Tasty GOLD"" are demanded by people within and outside the country. Due to reputation and goodwill the trademark and copyrighted work ""Tasty GOLD"" has become synonymous with plaintiff's products in the course of trade ""TASTY"" or ""GOLD"" either alone or in conjunction with any other work or feature whether of plaintiffs manufacture or not is referred to as emanating from the plaintiff only. Very recently, plaintiff came to know that certain other traders with mala fide intention to reap profits out of the goodwill of the plaintiff and in order to cause wrongful loss to the plaintiff are manufacturing and selling inferior quality products being exact imitation of plaintiff's trademark and copyrighted work ""TASTY GOLD"" Plaintiff made thorough market search and found that the defendant is using trademark ""GOLD Piece"" with exactly identical and deceptively similar packaging, design, colour scheme, get-up and livery and has also obtained cunningly registration with the Registrar of Copyright Karachi and such certificate has been issued to him on 10-1-2004 a day earlier to the filing of the opposition by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has stated that she has approached Central Copyright Board, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and has applied for issuance of certified extract of the work so registered with other necessary details.
 
Under these circumstances, the plaintiff has prayed for grant of temporary injunction till the disposal of the suit on the grounds that being the owner of registered trademark and copyright there is strong prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff, and she shall suffer irreparable loss if the injunction is not granted. The plaintiff has further stated that balance of convenience is also in favour of the grant of injunction.
 
Counter-affidavit to this application as well"" as written statement has been filed by Zeeshan Farooqi proprietor of the defendant's firm denying and disputing the claim of the plaintiff. In order to dislodge the claim of the plaintiff the defendant has stated that label used by the plaintiff consists of descriptive matter. The word ""Tasty"" appearing therein is a descriptive word within the meaning of Trademark Act, 1940 hence no monopoly rights over the word can be conferred upon any party. It has been further stated that the Registrar of the Trademark while granting the application of the plaintiff for trademark registration has imposed disclaimer upon the word ""Tasty"" as such no exclusive right accrued to the plaintiff in respect of the word Tasty within the meaning of Trademark Act, 1940. It is farther stated the trademark registration has been granted, to the plaintiff in Class 30 in respect of ""Tasty Label"". Thus in the said registration the dominant feature is the word ""Tasty"" which stand disclaimed. The defendant has further claimed that his firm has obtained registration of its goods with a label under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962 and plaintiff has no legal right 'to claim the relief. No infringement has been committed by the firm of the defendant and it is not a case of passing off the goods of the plaintiff. It has been categorically stated that label of the product of the plaintiff bears the photograph of her brother/cousin which itself constitutes a distinctive feature, and it is evident even from a cursory look at the two labels. The defendant has further stated that he is using the name ""GOLD Piece"" label for last about one year, thus, the balance of convenience is also in favour of the defendant. He has further stated that his firm has already filed trademark application No.190934 on 1-1-2004 for registration of his trademark as ""GOLD Piece"". Legal plea regarding maintainability of the application has also been raised.
 
In rejoinder to the counter-affidavit while denying the case set up by the defendant, it has been stated that by the plaintiff that use of the word ""GOLD"" which is exactly similar and deceptively identical to the registered copyright, amounts to in management of passing off. Factum of disclaimer has not been denied but it has been stated to be unjustified.
","Learned counsel for the plaintiff has mainly contended that plaintiff is engaged in the business of sweet scented supari (betel nuts) since the year 1979 and started using the trademark ""Tasty"" in the year 1980. Thereafter, the plaintiff adopted trademark of ""Tasty GOLD"" in the year 1986, and it has been registered with the Registrar of Trademark under No.72151 and 144394 in Class-30. She has further contended that the defendant has dishonestly adopted and undertaken the use of the mark ""GOLD Piece"" under a label design, which is identical and deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. Learned counsel has referred to section 21 of the Trade Mark Act 1940 to justify the exclusive right to use such mark. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further argued that by virtue of section 21 of the Trademark Act 1940 the plaintiff has got exclusive right to use the mark and under section 23 of the Act registration is the prima facie evidence of the proprietorship whereas under section 24 of the Act, after expiration of seven years from the date of such original registration, the original registration of the trademark shall be taken to be valid in all respects unless such registration was obtained by fraud, and according to the learned counsel there is no such allegation that the registration has been obtained by the plaintiff by fraud. Learned counsel has further argued that it took about five years to complete the process of registration of the mark in 1997 though the mark was advertised in the journal and neither any opposition was filed nor its registration was objected by anybody including the defendant at any time. Learned counsel has further argued that copyright in respect of artistic work in label under word Tasty GOLD wherein the word GOLD is written in a stylized manner forming an important and prominent feature with peculiar colour scheme which is distinctive of plaintiff's product, the defendants are infringing the rights of the plaintiff in respect of the said label design by using the trademark word GOLD on their packaging in the same manner and under same colour scheme with features in the manner which forms an integral part of plaintiff's registered copyrighted work. The two labels and wrappers have been placed on record for comparison.
learned counsel for the defendant has argued that no infringement has taken place as no renewal has yet been granted and as such the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff with reference to disclaimer is distinguishable more particularly when exclusive right under section 21 of the Act in the cases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff was not subject to disclaimer. She has further argued that while granting the registration of ""Tasty GOLD"" the Registrar has imposed a condition of disclaimer that words, matters and features cannot be registered. She has further argued that no one in the trade should be allowed to exploit or monopolize the marks and features commonly used by general public. Since no distinctiveness of the label was proved hence the Registrar has already concluded that the matters, features and words cannot be registered to the exclusion of others. Learned counsel further argued that no appeal was filed challenging the decision of the Registrar against disclaimer as provided under section 76 of the Act, hence the right to use the trademark material exclusively goes away.
Learned counsel has further argued that in view of the facts of the case on record no evidence of sale of this item (Tasty Gold) has been filed and the plaintiff has relied only upon advertisement of tasty gold that too as late as in 2003. No evidence of goodwill and reputation has been filed, distinctiveness has not been proved, nothing has been shown that the defendant's use is causing harm or damage, and there is no evidence to show that the defendant has mis-presented his goods to be that of the plaintiff and his use of the mark GOLD Piece has caused deception or confusion. Learned counsel has further argued that the defendant has neither copied the label as a whole, nor its essential features or any part thereof. Plaintiff's claim on the special calligraphy of GOLD is not correct as the traders of supari are commonly using the features and other common words such as GOLD and other material to describe their goods. The use by the defendant is simultaneous. Learned counsel has further argued that in passing of cases the Court required a very high standard proof before it grants injunction in favour of the plaintiff. 
Learned counsel has denied that any infringement of copyright has taken place as the defendant is using his own label, which is registered with Copyright Registrar and the plaintiff has stated that they will prefer rectification but once the registration is granted under the Copyright Law the same cannot be disturbed by impugning it, before the Court particularly when Copyright Registrar has not been made a party.
 

 
","Thus, I have come to a conclusion that there is no prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff to justify grant of injunction. Balance of convenience also does nor appear to be in favour of the plaintiff who shall not suffer any irreparable loss if injunction is refused. Resultantly, this application is rejected and the interim order granted on 28-1-2004 and extended from time to time is vacated. In this view of the matter application under Order XXXIX, Rule 4, C. P. C. is also dismissed having become infructuous.

","The general principles laid down for grant of injunction are well-settled. Plaintiff seeking injunction has to show that there is strong prima facie case in his/her favour apart from the balance of convenience and that the plaintiff shall suffer irreparable loss if injunction is not granted. Indeed, there can be no cavil with the proposition of law as laid down in various authorities cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff but it is well-settled principle of law that each case has its own merit and the law is to be applied keeping in view the facts of each case. . In the instant case the material being sold by the plaintiff as well as a large number of other sellers under various names is an item of common use viz. scented sweet supari (betel nuts). The defendant alongwith his written statement to show that word GOLD is being used by a large number of manufacturers of Sweet Supari or Scented Sweet Supari for last many years and the labels, wrappers and packets of each manufacturers are not identical, and appear to be different from each other though having some similarity in certain cases.
 
Indeed, the fact that so many other persons are illegally and unlawfully using identical wrappers, trade mark or labels, cannot be deemed to be a valid defence, but the fact remains that a look at the wrappers, packaging, colour scheme and calligraphy of the two labels being used by the plaintiff and defendant would show that the same are neither identical nor can be said to similar in all respects, and both appear to be distinctive from each other because the wrapper being used by the plaintiff has a peculiar colour scheme and calligraphy, it also bears the photograph of the brother or cousin of the plaintiff with a blue background which is an important distinguishing feature whereas the wrapper and label being used by defendant does not bear any such photograph. Word Tasty which find place on the wrapper of plaintiff in bold letters with a particular calligraphy and colour scheme is also not available on the wrapper being used by the defendant. Moreover, the defendant has admittedly registered his design, label and packaging with the concerned authority against which no appeal has been filed by the plaintiff, hence prima facie the defendant has a lawful defence available with him to resist the prayer for grant of injunction.

(Against the judgment dated 26.02.2021 of the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad passed in F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020)
","8th November, 2021.","MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.","It was averred that the petitioner and respondent No.1 entered into a partnership agreement to conduct business of promoting, developing and managing international franchises. A partnership firm was thus formed and registered by the name of Zakori International (""Zakori International""). Zakori International is currently operating two successful brands in Pakistan namely ""Mr. COD"" and ""RANCHERS"". ""RANCHERS"", being an indigenous brand of Zakori International, the trademark ""Ranchers"" has been registered under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance 2001""), in the joint name of the partners, being the petitioner and respondent No.1. It is further stated that under and in terms of a franchise agreement dated 13.10.2015, Zakori International granted to Messrs Royal Manor a limited license and franchise for operating a ""Ranchers"" Restaurant in Sector 1-8 (Markaz), Islamabad. However the respondent No.1, without the consent of the petitioner, entered, on behalf of Zakori International, into a tripartite Joint Venture Agreement (""JVA"") with Messrs Royal Manor, and one Afnan Shareef, the Respondent No.2, whereby Royal Manor agreed to take respondent No.2, as its joint venture partner in respect of the franchise restaurants operated by it under the name and style of ""Ranchers"", whereas Zakori International in terms of the said JVA, purportedly undertook to grant master franchising rights regarding ""Ranchers"" to respondent No.2. The petitioner contended that Zakori International could not have participated in the aforesaid JVA without the consent of the petitioner. It was further contended that by having agreed to extend to respondent No.2, the right of master franchising ""Ranchers"" unilaterally, and without the consent of the petitioner, the respondent No.2 has clearly infringed the registered trade mark, jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, against the clear restriction imposed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001. In addition to the above, according to the petitioner, respondent Nos.1 and 2, have incorporated a Private Limited Company by the name of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3, mainly for the same business as is being conducted by Zakori International under its trade mark ""Ranchers"". It was contended that the use of the trade mark/name, ""Ranchers"", by respondent No.3 company, will create an impression and lead to a belief that the entity is not different from, ""Ranchers"" jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, and such would ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"". under heightened security.","The first grievance of the petitioner that emerges from the plain reading of the plaint, and as noted earlier, is that though the petitioner and respondent No.1 are the co-owners of the registered trade mark ""Ranchers"" and the partnership agreement between the two does not authorize any of them to grant a license to the use of the said trade mark, or assign or charge each other's share therein, and exactly to the same effect is the restriction placed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001, however the respondent No.1 without the petitioner's consent granted master franchise rights in respect of the subject trade mark to respondent No.2, which is clearly violative of the above provision and thus in terms of subsection (6) of section 24 of the said Ordinance, which clearly entitles the aggrieved co-proprietor to initiate infringement proceedings in such an eventuality, the petitioner was/is fully competent to institute the proceedings as he did.
7. The other grievance as set out in the plaint is that the respondent No.1 and respondent No.2, along with two others have incorporated a private limited company by the name and style of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3. It is contended that the name of the company conspicuously bearing the name ""Ranchers"" whose principal line of business is the same as that being conducted by the Zakori International under the trade mark/name ""Ranchers"" would lead a consumer into believing that the respondent No.3 company is associated with the ""Ranchers"" brand owned by Zakori International, and thus using the name ""Ranchers"" as above is a clear infringement of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" as described/explained by section 40 of the Ordinance 2001, in terms whereof a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses, in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or deceitfully similar thereto, in relation to similar goods or services for which the same is registered, whereas subsection (5) of section 40 holds unauthorized use of a registered trade mark as one's own trade name or part of his trade name, as an infringement of the trade mark, and this is what exactly is being complained of by the petitioner.
","In view of the forgoing we convert this petition into an appeal and allow the same, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the tribunal to proceed therewith in accordance with law.","Although, as noted above, the respondents' acts and conduct as alleged by the petitioner clearly falls under sections 24 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 respectively, but for the sake of clarity we may observe here that use of trade mark can also be attributed to the person who has got to the stage where he can be seen objectively to have committed himself to use the mark that is to carrying his intention to use the mark into effect. Use of trade mark can therefore be demonstrated also through the intention to offer the goods and services and/or services, which are manifested through preparatory steps which show an objective commitment to using the trade mark, whereas in the instant case the respondents, in addition to having violated specific provisions of Ordinance, 2001, have also gone beyond the preparatory steps. We wonder as to where from the question of so called physical use arose.
Keeping in view certain observations found in the judgments of the fora below, we feel that a clear exposition with regard to the concept of passing off would be beneficial, and it would be appropriate to reproduce the concept as enunciated in Harvard's Law Review, Volume 68 (1954-1955) on the subject of development in the law.
Whereas though in the instant case, the petitioner contended that use of ""Ranchers"", as part of the company's name ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"", however, as noted earlier, has in fact alleged violation of specific restriction imposed by two separate provisions of Ordinance 2001, which are clearly based on infringement of petitioner's trade mark, within the meaning of the said two provisions.
It may also be relevant to note that what is described as a passing off action may either be a passing off action simplicitor or an action of infringement of trade mark coupled with passing off. Where the case of passing off action is based on infringement of trade mark, such suit shall necessarily require determination of the question whether there had been any infringement of the trade mark and where infringement of trade mark is alleged the suit must, in view of sections 17, 18 and 39 of the IPO Act, 2012, be instituted before the tribunal notwithstanding that the allegations in the suit were coupled with the allegation of passing off.

Suit No.640 of 2006, decided on 9th August, 2006.",,,"Through this injunction application, the plaintiff seeks restraining order against the defendants from infringing and/or passing their right in respect of the trade mark, house mark, service mark, Trade name ""DEWAN"" by using the trade mark Daily DEWAN for their newspaper, service and or any other product.

(6) The cost of the suit may kindly be awarded.
 
(7) Any further relief, this Court deems just and equitable may also be granted.
 
The plaintiff claims to be a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance 1984. It has been pleaded that the l plaintiff is member of prestigious ""DEWAN MUSHTAQ GROUP"" one of the leading; reputed and most prominent groups in Pakistan and has an annual turnover exceeding Pak Rupees 20 billions. The plaintiff has further, pleaded that their main fields of business include textiles, sugar, polyester and acrylic staple fibre, assembly-sum-progressive manufacture of automobiles, Equity participation in a private bank, foods and fast moving consumer goods and other allied business. The plaintiff claims that since 1916 the Dewan Mushtaq Group was set up and in 1947 the Dewan Family migrated in Pakistan: Somewhere in 1999, the plaintiff claims to have got registered their trade lame/trade mark ""Dewan"" under Trade Marks Act 1940. It is further claimed by the plaintiff that plaintiff has also been registered under different classifications in Class-1 to Class-45 inclusive of Class-16, which pertains to item news. letters and 'newspapers'.
 with new technological evidence.","It has been contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that in the face of these documents which includes registration under Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, the defendants have no lawful right to undertake any publication in. 1 he trademark of ""DEWAN"" which is registered trademark of the plaintiff. According to the learned counsel for the plaintiff that section 40(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001 protects the rights of the plaintiffs, and the defendants who are running the newspaper in the name of Daily ""DEWAN"" are debarred to undertake publication in such trademark, as such an act of the defendants infringes the rights of the plaintiff guaranteed under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001.
 
It was further contended that distinct nature of business has hardly any role in the use of the registered trademark of the 1 plaintiff. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001 which is the corresponding section of 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940. In support of her contention, the learned counsel has relied upon the case of Alpha Sewing Machine v: Registrar of Trade Marks reported in PLD 1990 SC Page 1074. 'The learned counsel has submitted that the Honourable Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has held that if there is element of deception or confusion then any such element in respect of nature of business the registered trademark cannot be used by the other party.
 
As against this the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has submitted that the defendants have not undertaken any manufacturing business, but are publishing newspaper which is distinct business and law does not restrict them from using such name. He further submits that the defendants have been granted declaration by the Federal Government to publish daily ""DEWAN"" and this declaration has been endorsed by the DCO, City District Government, Karachi. He therefore, submits irrespective of the registered trademark (DEWAN) of the plaintiff, they can undertake the business of publication in the lame of daily 'Dewan'.
","Under these circumstances I am of the considered view that the plaintiff prima facie had made out a case for grant of .injunction and allowing to use the trade mark ""DEWAN"" by the defendants would cause inconvenience and would lead to deception and confusion in terms of the provision of section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. The balance of convenience also rests with the plaintiff for the purpose of granting of injunction, I therefore, allow this injunction application, restraining the defendants from using the trade name/trademark word DEWAN "" "" in their publication.
 
","Class 16 of the International Classification of goods and services clearly provides that if trademark is registered the same cannot be used by any other person in the face of the provision of section 40(4) read with section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Mere granting of declaration under the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance 2002 does not authorise the defendants to infringe, the right of the plaintiff guaranteed under the provision of the registered. Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The scope of granting of declaration is independent of the provision of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Grant of declaration sloes not give rise to a party a right to use the registered trade mark of another party under the garb of distinct nature of business. The learned counsel for the defendant has failed to cite any case-law in support of his contention to show that publication of the newspaper under the provision of Press Council of. Pakistan Ordinance, 2002 on the basis of a declaration does not excludes the right of .infringement of the plaintiff under the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001.
 
The contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff appeals to reason. Once a trade mark/trade is registered under the provision of Trade Mark Ordinance 2001 then it restricts the other party from using such trademark. Moreso when it is g distinct and use of it would lead to confusion or deception. The agreement, of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is weighty and the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court on the issue also supports the case in hand.

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN and 2 others---Respondents
","F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020, decided on 26th February, 2021.","3rd February, 2021.
JUDGMENT
","GHULAM AZAM QAMBRANI, J.","Brief facts necessary for adjudication of this appeal are that the appellant filed a suit for perpetual injunction against infringement of registered trade mark against the defendants contending therein that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 entered into a partnership agreement at Islamabad on 28.11.2013, forming a Firm in the name and style of ""Messrs Zakori International"" with its office at Murree Road, Rawalpindi; that the said Firm was duly registered with Registrar of Firms Rawalpindi under the partnership Act; that after establishing Messrs Zakori International, the appellant/plaintiff became busy in his other business ventures abroad. The appellant/plaintiff had to act as a dormant partner of Messrs Zakori International, hence he reposed his complete trust in respondent/defendant No.1 on the basis of family relationship and past association; that respondent No.1 was running all the day to day affairs of the Firm since beginning and all the record of business and accounts was in his control. However, as per business needs, the appellant/plaintiff used to inject capital in the business as required by respondent No.1; that bank account of Messrs Zakori International was also operated by respondent No.1, who was also having control over the business of Messrs Zakori International and the appellant/plaintiff had complete trust and confidence in him; that Messrs Zakori international is currently operating two successful brands i.e. Mr. COD with 22 branches across Pakistan, two in Afghanistan and one in Bahrain and Ranchers, an indigenous brand of Zakori International having two branches one in the Rawalpindi and the other in Islamabad; that trade mark Ranchers has been registered jointly in the name of respondent/defendant No.1 and the appellant/plaintiff under section 33(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 by the Registrar of Trade Mark vide No.401490 dated 06.11.2015, which means that all the Intellectual property rights relating to the Ranchers are vested in Zakori International, which in equal shares, is jointly owned by the appellant/plaintiff and respondent No.1; that despite the fact that the appellant and respondent No.1 were joint owners of the registered trade mark namely ""Ranchers"", respondent No.1 initiated the process of granting master franchising rights of Ranchers to respondent No.2 without obtaining prior consent from the appellant by executing a Joint ventures partnership agreement for Ranchers the J.V agreement was made on 01.04.2017, at Islamabad. The grievance of the appellant is that respondent No.1 without consent of the plaintiff and in violation of the partnership deed dated 28.11.2013, is executing joint venture partnership agreement of ""Ranchers"" with defendant No.2, through defendant No.3 in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; that signing of the joint agreement by defendant No.1 with defendant No.2 without consent and approval of plaintiff constitutes infringement of registered trade mark of plaintiff within the meaning of section 40(5) read with section 46 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. under different legal circumstances.",The main proposition falling for determination is as to whether the learned Tribunal has the jurisdiction or not.,"For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order does not call for any interference at this end, hence the appeal is devoid of any substance, therefore, the same is dismissed.","Here the question arises that whether mere usage of registered trademark belonging to a person by another person constitutes infringement and whether that usage need to be necessarily in the course of trade and whether usage of trade mark while executing any agreement constitutes infringement. The contention of the appellant side is that agreement between defendants Nos.1 and 2 has been executed in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, therefore, the same constitutes an infringement within the meaning of section 40(5) of the Ordinance, ibid, and accordingly the same is actionable under section 46(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, meaning thereby that according to section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, the defendant ought to physically use the trade mark of the plaintiff in the course of trade for constituting any infringement. In the instant case, the situation seems to be entirely different because the trade mark partially owned by the plaintiff has not been used, as yet, therefore, there is no question of infringement by the defendants in the course of trade.
10. A careful examination of the record reveals that the instant suit has been filed only on account of signing of an agreement between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 and the stage of use of the trade mark has not yet reached. According to the contents of the plaint, defendant No.1, who is the joint owner of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" with the plaintiff is assigning the registered trade mark to defendant No.2 through an agreement dated 01.04.2017 without seeking the approval of plaintiff being the co-owner of the trade mark, in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The plaintiff while considering this action of defendant No.1 as an infringement of his registered trade mark has filed the instant suit. Thus the actual dispute is between co-owners of the trade mark and the plaintiff has filed the instant suit to restrain his co-owner i.e. defendant No.1 from entering into a franchise agreement of the trademark with defendant No.2. This Court has failed to find any express provision in the Trade Marks Ordinance, which prohibits a co-owner of a trade mark to enter into an agreement qua the subject trade mark with anyone else. Similarly, there is no provision in the Ordinance, ibid, which empowers a co-owner to file a suit against the other co-owner qua the issue of infringement. Similarly, there is no denial of the fact that any violation of section 24(5) read with section 69 of the Trade Marks Ordinance falls within the jurisdiction of a District Court under section 117 of the Trade Mark Ordinance and, as such, the Tribunal cannot adjudicate upon a controversy between the co-owners of the trade mark.
11. The next proposition, which boils down for determination is whether a dispute of partnership between the co-owners of a trade mark can be settled by the Tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction within the meaning of section 18 of the IPO Act. This court has carefully attended this aspect of the matter. Prior to the IPO Act 2012 all civil suits/proceedings regarding protection of intellectual property rights were filed before the District Judge under section 117 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The relevant Section of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is reproduced hereunder in verbatim:-
""Suits for infringement to be instituted before District Court. No suit for the infringement of a trade mark or otherwise relating to any right in a trade mark shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.""

","F.A.Os. Nos. 326 and 327 of 2012, decided on 12th February, 2018.","26th January, 2018.","SHAHID KARIM, J.","This appeal lays a challenge to the order dated 08.05.2012 passed by the Registrar of Trademarks, Lahore. The impugned order decided two cross rectification applications. Rectification No.15 of 2010 was filed against the registration No.158845 in class 17 registered in the name of Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd., Peshawar. Rectification Application No.26 of 2011 was filed against the registration No.84678 in class 17, registered in the name of Royal Enterprises, Lahore. For the sake of brevity, Rectification No.15 of 2010 filed by Royal Enterprises, Lahore shall be referred as the ""Rectification 15"" and the Rectification No.26 of 2011 shall be referred as ""Rectification 26"".
2. This judgment shall decide two appeals, the instant appeal FAO No.326 of 2012 and F.A.O. No. 327 of 2012 filed by Muhammad Ismail (Appellant) against the order of the Registrar Trademarks dated 08.05.2012 by which order the trademark (Royal) registration bearing No.84678 in class 17 was expunged from the trademark register and the trademark (Royal) of Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. bearing No.158845 in class 17 was retained on the register of trademark.
3. The appellant filed application, Rectification 15 against the trademark 'Royal' on the ground inter alia that:
a. That the application for trademark 'Royal' was filed on 03.12.1984 and was assigned to the present proprietor on 03.10.2005;
b. That the said trademark was being used since that time by the appellant;
c. That the registration of trademark Royal hearing No.158845 was secured by the respondent through fraud and with the sole object of making wrong gain out of the goodwill and reputation of the appellant's trademark registered earlier in time relating to the same goods; and
d. That the registration of the impugned trademark was obtained without sufficient cause and was liable to be rectified from the register of trademarks.
4. The respondent had, on an earlier occasion, filed an application for rectification of the register under section 73(a) and (b) of the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001 before the Sindh High Court at Karachi for the removal of the appellant's trademark. It was held by the Sindh High Court that the proper forum for such an application was the Registrar of Trademarks and could not be filed directly before the High Court. The respondent was permitted to file an application for revocation of registration of the appellant's trademark before the Registrar Trademarks and consequently the respondent flied Rectification 26 in respect of trademark of appellant on the ground of non user of mark.
 under unusual conditions.","On the basis of pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed by the Registrar of Trademarks:-
a. Whether the applicant namely Royal Enterprises, Lahore was a person aggrieved in the circumstances of the case?
b. Whether the Registration of Trademark under No.1 58845 in class 17 for ""Royal"" was obtained by the Respondent namely Royal PVC (Pvt.) Limited, Peshawar in bad faith and by fraud.
c. Whether the mark registered under No.84678 in Class 17 in the name of Royal Enterprises, Lahore is liable to be removed from the Register due to non-user of the mark.
","In view of the above, the impugned decision of the Registrar Trademark is unexceptional and is hereby upheld. The appeals filed by the appellant are consequently dismissed.","The primary contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant was that the Registrar Trademarks travelled beyond the pleadings of the parties and rendered a decision on the basis of clause 'b' of subsection (1) of section 73. Precisely, the case of the appellant is that the respondent had challenged the trademark registration of the appellant on the touchstone of clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 73 and clause 'b' was not at all the basis for the challenge while the Registrar Trademarks had rendered its decision on the basis of clause 'b' and not clause 'a'. which has impinged upon the right of the appellant to be treated fairly and with due process of law. According to the learned counsel, since the challenge on the basis of clause 'b' was not in the contemplation of the appellant, he was precluded from adducing the relevant evidence relating to allegations of non-user for the last five years prior to the making of the rectification application. However, the issue at 'c' reproduced above, relates to the question as to whether the mark registered in the name of the appellant was liable to be removed from the register due to non user of the mark. The said issue fails to identify whether it relates to clause 'a' or clause 'b' and contrary to the claim of the appellant the issue is couched in unreal terms and places the onus on the appellant to prove not only the allegation with regard to clause 'a' but also with regard to clause 'b'. It may be stated that the first five years envisaged by clause 'a' would commence from 03.12.1984 and would extend to 03.12.1989 whereas the period covered by clause 'b' will commence from March, 2006 and end in March, 2011, till the filing of the application by the respondent. However, paragraph 26 of the rectification application filed by the respondent puts paid to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant which forms the main plank of the attack of the appellant to the impugned decision rendered by the Registrar Trademarks. It has specifically been mentioned in paragraph 26 that the challenge as both on the basis of clause 'a' and clause 'b' of subsection (1) of section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 and not merely on the basis of clause 'a' alone. Therefore, the appellant was obliged to adduce the relevant material and evidence which would bring home the fact that the appellant was not guilty of lack of use of the trademark for both the periods contemplated by clause 'a' and clause 'b'.
It can be seen from the list of documents reproduced above, that these documents do not establish neither the requirement of clause 'a' nor of clause 'b' and it does not matter whether additional evidence is allowed to be produced or not. To reiterate, none of the above documents are proof of user between 1984 and 1989 (the first five years). This is on account of the fact that whether it be a case under clause 'a' or 'b' the appellant has not brought home the onus placed by issue 'c' and has failed to discharge that onus. Both the applications C.M. 1 of 2013 and C.M. 1 of 2014 are, therefore, dismissed.
Learned counsel for the respondent rightly pointed out that the only raw material for the manufacture of the goods by both the appellant as well as the respondent is PVC Raisin and for which a company by the name of Engro Polymer is the only suppliers and, therefore, the most pertinent and relevant evidence was the invoices etc. in respect of the supplies from Engro Polymer. The appellant has not attached any document which would show the supplies to have been made by Engro Polymer to the appellant for the manufacture of UPVC Pipe. The documents produced by the appellant with the Registrar Trademarks and now sought to be produced as additional evidence do not show the use of material which conforms to the Pakistan Standards. Also the electricity and gas bills have not been produced in order to show that the manufacturing facility of the appellant is in operation. Contrarily, the respondent has produced documents before the Registrar which show clearly that the respondent has been in use of the trademark ""Royal"". Documents were produced to the effect that the respondent was registered with the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority in respect of UPVC pressure pipes for cold potable water of royal brand. The certificate shows that the respondent is making annual marking fee of 0.05% of the annual production value for the continued validity of the certificate. Similarly the respondent is an approved contractor for the supply of UPVC pipes in respect of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Jammu and Kashmir health departments. Apart from this, the respondent produced a license from Pakistan Engineering Council dated 23.12.2006 which mentions its field of specialization of UPVC pipes which further lends support to the contention of the respondent that it is a bona fide manufacturer of UPVC pipes and use of trademark ""Royal"". The most crucial documents submitted by the respondent before the Registrar of Trademarks were sales tax invoices, sale tax returns and export documents for the period between 2006 to 2011 which clearly mention the word ""Royal"" as trademark as well as value of the products and the sales tax paid on it. Export invoices have also been attached by the respondent which are required to be furnished by the exporter pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and attested by the State Bank of Pakistan.",MWA/M-35/L Appeals dismissed.,Dismissed

Besides, through the sale of its commercial vehicles, it has also established itself as a major player in the automotive industries and the most popular categories of its vehicles are MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE. It is further alleged that in the year 2015, the MMC collaborated with Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co. Ltd. and established a manufacturing plant in Karachi and the vehicles manufactured and assembled by the MMC with the collaboration of said company are being sold under various brands such as MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. It is also alleged that the MMC's vehicles sold under the trademark/trade name MASTER, either alone or in conjunction with another mark, have become well reputed amongst transporters and are in high demand in Pakistan and other countries including USA, UAE, Bangladesh, India and Afghanistan and MMC has duly secured its rights in the brand MASTER and obtained registration of the same in the relevant class-12 with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. It is the claim of MMC that being the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER, it owns the exclusive rights of selling, trading and dealing with the said trademark/trade name. It is further claim of the MMC that the trademark MASTER is associated exclusively with it, rendering the unauthorized use of it in conjunction with any other mark in respect of the same or similar products by other manufactures, service providers and traders as infringement of the MMC's vested rights and any such unauthorized use would also tantamount to passing off as well as unfair competition. It is case of the MMC that the MRC is engaged in the import, distribution and sale of infringing products bearing trademark/trade name MASTER, that products include buses under the mark 'ROAD MASTER' which is deceptively similar to the MMC's registered trademark MASTER in sheer negation and contravention of statutory provision enunciated under sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 and such inexcusable act is an infringement of MMC's exclusive proprietary rights vested in the trademark MASTER for which it is entitled to a relief under section 46 of the Ordinance, 2001. It is further case of MMC that MRC has imported the said infringing goods into Pakistan via Sri Lanka; hence, MMC apprehends that more consignments may be en-routed. It is also case of MMC that it has filed a complaint with Director General IPR (Enforcement), Islamabad under the relevant laws to take enforcement action and detain the infringing goods/vehicles, which is still pending adjudication; however, MMC in order to ensure that the infringing vehicles are not released, have approached this Court through this suit. MMC has filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019, under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C., seeking interim injunctive relief restraining MRC, its agents etc. from using/ infringing the trademark MASTER from marketing, promoting, trading, importing and selling through retail outlets or online and from infringing products under the mark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER in any manner whatsoever and/or any close variation thereof till disposal of this suit. While C.M.A. No.7781/2019 has been filed by the MRC, under Order XXXIX, rule 4 read with section 151, C.P.C., seeking vacation, discharge and modification in interim relief granted by this Court, vide orders dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019 and C.M.A. No.10445/2019 has been filed by MMC, under Order XXXIX, rule 2(3), C.P.C., read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Act, seeking attachment of the properties and an order detaining the proposed contemnors in civil prison for breach of ad-interim orders, dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019, passed by this Court. with new evidence presented.","Mr. Mirza Mehmood Baig, learned counsel for MMC/plaintiff, while arguing listed applications in Suit No. 596/2019 has reiterated the facts of the plaint in said suit. He has contended that MMC is the registered proprietor of the trademark MASTER not only in Class 12 which pertains to the manufacture of the buses and apparatus for locomotion but also in Class 39 which pertains to transportation services and since MRC (defendant No.1 in said suit) is engaged in the import, distribution and/or sale of the infringing products bearing the trademark MASTER including buses under the mark ROAD MASTER, which is imitated mark upon the same goods of MMC, it filed Suit No.596/2019 inter alia to restrain MRC from using, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling of the plaintiff's products under the trademark MASTER and/or any variation thereof. He has further contended that vide ad-interim order, dated 01.04.2019, this Court restrained MRC from using the trademark and selling or infringing MMC's trademark MASTER; thereafter, vide order dated 15.4.2019, this Court extended the scope of the said ad-interim order to defendants Nos.2 to 7 and restrained them from releasing the goods carrying trademark of MMC and it was, thereafter, the MRC filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019 in said suit seeking discharge and/or modification of said interim order. He has further contended that the MRC has filed its counter affidavit to C.M.A. No. 5145/2019 wherein it has provided history of all its activities outside the transportation category with chronological developments and trademark registrations and applications that are entirely irrelevant to Classes 12 and 39. He has added that MRC instead of rebutting MMC's indomitable assertion and plea that it is the prior user and registered proprietor of the mark MASTER, placed its entire focus on irrelevant assertions, and miserably failed to establish prior use of the mark MASTER or ROAD MASTER upon buses or transportation services and MMC has already responded through its rejoinder to the counter affidavit submitted by MRC in response to the MMC's said C.M.A., wherein among other strong rebuttals, it has also been pointed out that MMC had secured interim relief in its favour as to the exclusive use of the trademark MASTER in numerous cases and foremost and relevant example of such relief in favour of MMC came about in Suit No.98/2019, filed before IPT Lahore, the very basis of that was its registration of the mark MASTER in Class 39.
On the other hand, Ms. Amna Salman Ahmed, learned counsel for MRC/defendant No.1 in Suit No.596/2019 while reiterating the facts of the plaint in Suit No.880/2019 has maintained that MMC has falsely claimed the ownership of the trademark MASTER, as the same has never been used by it, so also ROAD MASTER, for the goods and services falling in class 39, which MRC has been carrying out for its passenger and cargo transportation business. She has further maintained that the MMC has misused and abused its totally different class 12, Registration No.187815, which was malafidely and fraudulently obtained by it despite the fact that several MASTER formative marks were prior registered in class 12, therefore, MRC has filed J.M No. 28 of 2019 for the cancellation of the alleged registration of the trademark MASTER in class 12. She has also maintained that MRC is the bona fide user of mark ROAD MASTER in class 39 being the prior user of the said mark, furthermore, MMC has no justification to claim any right in relation to MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER used as a service mark in class 39 for passengers and cargo transportation services as they have never used MASTER or ROAD MASTER as a service mark for passengers and cargo transport services in class 39. She has further maintained that MRC's Master Group of Companies has honestly been using the trademark MASTER for four decades and it is well known throughout Pakistan and around the world, particularly in Middle East, therefore, MMC has no grounds to challenge the MRC's use of the trademark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER, by filing a suit and obtaining restraining orders against the MRC. She has added that MMC has violated section 19 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. She has further added that MMC has no legal or moral right to press its illegal demands against MRC. She has also maintained that the averments made by MMC in the suit are unauthorized, mala fide and an act of fraud upon MRC and the public and in fact MMC is attempting to get benefit from the impression that they are the exclusive users and owners of the trademark MASTER and ROAD MASTER, otherwise the fact that they neither have any prior use nor do they have any current use in class 39 clearly proves their malicious intentions. She has added that MMC has failed to make out a prima facie case against the MRC nor have they been able to prove that they have suffered any irreparable loss whatsoever and the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of MMC; and it is the MRC who is suffering irreparable loss due to mala fide and illegal actions of MMC restraining MRC's buses at the port which are to be used for transport services and; therefore, the application for interim injunction (C.M.A. No. 5145/2019) is liable to be dismissed. ","The interim relief has already been confirmed in favour of MMC in Suit No. 596 of 2019 by denying the same to MRC in Suit No. 880 of 2019. Hence, C.M.A. No.7496/2019 is dismissed being devoid of merit. While C.M.A. No.10447/2019, filed by the MMC under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. seeking rejection of J.M is dismissed as the learned counsel has failed to refer the provision of law under that the instant J.M. is not maintainable. Moreover, the MRC under the law has right to challenge the registration of subject trademark on legal and factual grounds; the merit thereof cannot by decided without recording pro and contra evidence of the parties.
Above are the reasons of my short order, dated 19.08.2020, whereby C.M.A. No. 5145 of 2019 in Suit No. 596 of 2019 was allowed and rest of the C.M.As. were dismissed.
","In terms of section 39 (ibid), a registered trade mark is a property and proprietor thereof thus has an exclusive right in a registered trademark and in case of any infringement, the proprietor has the right to obtain any relief under the Ordinance, 2001 and under any other law for the time being in force. Section 40 covers the instances and provides elements of the infringements. Under section 40(1), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in a course of trade, a mark which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services, which are identical with those, for which it is registered. Under section 40(2), a person infringes a registered trade mark if such person uses in the course of trade a mark which is deceptively similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to the goods or services for which the trade mark is registered. Under section 40(3), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to (a) goods of the same description as that of goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered; (b) services that are closely related to goods in respect of which trade mark is registered; (c) services of the same description as that of services in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or (d) goods that are closely related to services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Section 40 (4) provides that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trademark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered when deceptively similar to the registered trade mark. Section 40(5) stipulates that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses such registered trade mark as his trade name or part of his trade name.
It appears from the pleadings of the parties that MMC claims to be a part of Master Group of Industries and is indulged in sale of commercial vehicles in the name of MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE and also manufacturing and selling buses under brand name MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. Profiles of said vehicles are annexed with plaint as annexure ""D"" at page 193 to 223. MMC claims that it has protected its rights in the brand MASTER by obtaining registration of the same in the relevant Class 12 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, pertaining to vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water, with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. Trademark Registration Certificate is annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""F"" at page 227.
it has been asserted that MMC is not the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER for passenger and cargo transport business and services in Class 39 and it is the MRC who has prior use of ROAD MASTER as a service mark in said class. In its Affidavit-in-Rejoinder, MMC while rebutting the said assertion of the MRC has stated that it has been using the trademark MASTER upon services falling in class 39 since long before its use by MRC. Learned counsel for the MMC with his written synopsis has filed copy of the Trademark Registration Certificate bearing No. 197433 with filing date as 19-06-2004, which shows that MMC's trademark MASTER is registered in class 39, which was renewed for 10 years with effect from 19.06.2014 to 19.06.2024. It has been observed in the case of Messrs Dewan (supra) by this Court that once a trademark is registered under the provisions of Ordinance, 2001 it restricts the other parties from using such trade mark.",MH/M-50/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interim injunctive relief sought.","I have noticed that the similarity between the two marks is so striking and the intention to infringe is so obvious that the argument of balance of convenience is of no avail to the defendant. I am also of the view that since prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff; it does not open to the defendants to say that they ought to be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong. Moreover, the pendency of the application of defendant No.2 for registration of his mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks will not disentitle the plaintiff being proprietor of a registered trade mark from his exclusive right to its use and that such right will be deemed to be infringed by any person who uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling to as it likely to deceive or cause confusion in view of sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance.

","Civil Original No. 1161 of 2015, decided on 10th December, 2018.","10th December, 2018.","SHAHID KARIM, J.","The facts are simple and may be stated shortly. The parties are on common ground with regard to a substantial portion of the facts. The applicant is a company registered under the laws of Kingdom of Thailand and is a global distributor of the world's leading cosmetics brands including but not limited to Tellme, Nature Bright, Sunway. Lawland, Effi'n, Elfi'. Promina cover Art and Arche'. The applicant is a worldwide agent of Arche products and its various brands of cosmetics which include Arche' Pure Thai Pearl Cream, Arche' White and Brite, Arche' White Pearl Cream etc. Paragraph 4 of the petition gives a list of the countries and the detail of the registration of Arche trade mark in the name of the applicant. In short, the applicant is the exclusive owner of the trade mark `Arche' and on this basis establishes its right over the intellectual property relating to Arche. The respondent No.3 is the authorized agent of the applicant in Pakistan and is responsible for marketing, selling or exporting its products in Pakistan. The applicant in its capacity as the exclusive owner of the intellectual property in Arche products applied for the registration of the trade mark 'Arche' in Pakistan on 11.05.1973 in respect of perfumery, lotions and other cosmetic goods falling in Class-3. The Registrar Trade Mark, Pakistan registered the following trade mark having registration No.58907 in the name of the applicant w.e.f. 11.05.1973:
 
5. The trade mark was renewed from time to time and lastly according to the contents of the application, w.e.f. 11.05.2009 for a period of ten years and continued to be registered in the name of the applicant till date. According to the applicant, vide application dated 26.3.2014 the applicant has further applied for the registration of trade marks for various other products in Class-3 and the process of registration of the trade marks is pending with the respondent No.2. During this time, the applicant became aware of the fact regarding registration of identical trade mark by Hamza for cosmetics products which is similar to the earlier trade mark of the applicant and resembles the said trade mark in material particular. The trade mark of Hamza was registered as trade mark No.247291 in Class-3 on 7.8.2014 w.e.f. 3.3.2008. The following is the pictorial depiction of the trade mark registered in the name of Hamza:
 with an additional plaintiff.","This application under section 80 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance, 2001) seeks the invalidation of the entry in Trade Marks Register regarding the Trade Mark No.247291 dated 03.03.2008 in Class-3 (""The Trade Mark""). The said trade mark belongs to respondent No.1 (trading as Hamza Cosmetics) (hereinafter, Hamza). In a nub, the case of the applicant is that the registration of the trade mark be declared invalid on the ground that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001. Primarily the declaration of invalidity has been sought or the ground of section 80(3)(a) and (b) which provide that:
""Grounds for invalidity of registration.-
(3) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground that there is-
(a) an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions set out in subsections (1), (2) or (3) of section 17 obtain: or
(b) an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out in subsection (4) of section 17 is satisfied, unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right has consented to the registration.
","During the course of the hearing the original record was produced by the office of the Registrar which shows the application of the trade mark made on 3.3.2008. A show cause notice was issued under section 27 of the Ordinance, 2001 to Hamza with specific reference to the trade mark registered in favour of the applicant priorly and on the basis of earlier conflicting trade mark. It cannot be gleaned from the record as to whether these proceedings culminated in an order passed by the Registrar or not. Be that as it may, the trade mark was registered ultimately and for whose invalidity the instant proceedings have been brought by the applicant.
19. In view of the above, this application is allowed. Trade mark registration No.247291 dated 3.3.2008 is declared invalid under the provisions of section 80(1) read with sections 14 and 14(4) of the Ordinance, 2001, and is struck off the Register of Trade Marks.
The original record which was retained with the Court Associate of this Court vide order dated 13.11.2018 is handed over to the representative of the Trade Mark Department present in the Court.
","Thus, according to the portion quoted in Jamia Industries Ltd., marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollect of the whole. Moreover, variations in details might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own. Also while determining whether a mark bears resemblance to another mark and is likely to deceive, the underlying rule is to determine by considering what is the leading characteristic of each of these marks.
13. The marks of both, the applicant as well as Hamza, have been reproduced above and there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the two marks resemble each other to such an extent that they are likely to deceive the mind of an unwary customer who will have to rely upon the leading characteristic of the mark of the applicant which characteristics are also comprised in and are part of the mark registered in the name of Hamza. Upon a visual comparison too the two marks are identical to each other and the mark registered in the name of Hamza has been registered for goods similar to those for which the earlier trade mark of the applicant was registered.
14. To reiterate the real question to decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon an average mind of ordinary intelligence would look to a particular trade mark and what impression he would form by looking at the trade mark. Applying the aforesaid principles to the instant case, not only visual appearance of the two marks are similar but they also relate to the same products and thus an average mind of ordinary intelligence would consider the goods of Hamza as that of the applicant. Thus, the registration in the name of Hamza is likely to deceive or confuse the customers. Also the applicant is the exclusive user of the mark not only in Pakistan but equally in other countries and has acquired the proprietorship of the mark and lays a rightful claim to the intellectual property of the said mark.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 64 of 2017, decided on 12th January, 2018.","27th November, 2017","MRS. ASHRAF JAHAN, J.","The facts leading to the present appeal as per case of the Appellant are that they are proprietor of ""Moonlite Trading Company"", (hereinafter referred to as (""the Appellant Company""), which is a merchant, importer and marketer of self-designed consumer goods and other items. Since last several decades the Appellant Company is carrying the business of merchant and import of consumer goods including lotions, toiletries, perfumes, deodorants, air-fresheners, diapers and insecticides in Pakistan. The products imported by the Appellant Company are being marketed and sold under various Trade Marks, which include Cobra, Lotion Cobra, Soft Touch, Ku Ku, Lotion Saffire, Mascot, etc. They have also developed distinctive designs, logos or artwork for use in connection with the aforesaid brands including Appellant's current and long standing Trade Mark ""COBRA"". Therefore, in its pursuance, the Appellant Company obtained registration of the Trade Mark ""COBRA"" under Registration No.99323 in international class 05 since 11.08.1988 under the Ordinance, 2001, which registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes till today. In order to further strengthen its proprietorship, the Appellant either directly or through their company has also secured copyright registration under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962. The Appellant's product bearing ""COBRA"" has been and continued to be sold and promoted extensively throughout Pakistan since year 1988 without any hindrance from any quarter and thus they had invested substantial amount in the promotion and publicity of the product bearing ""COBRA"" mark and therefore, the Appellant company enjoys an enviable reputation and goodwill in the said Trade Mark in Pakistan.
It is further the case of the Appellant that on or about 31.03.2010, Respondent No.2 applied for the Registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", which was accepted for publication in the Trade Mark Journal in order to invite Opposition and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 733 in the month of February, 2012. Immediately upon becoming aware of such publication, the Appellant filed a Notice of Opposition bearing Opposition No.455/2013 against the grant of Registration of Mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" on the ground, inter alia, that the Trade Mark applied for is identical to the Appellant's trade mark ""COBRA"" and is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the consumers. In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Opposition, Respondent No.2 filed its counter statement contending that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was adopted in 2009 in order to distinguish its goods from other competitors and Notice of Opposition is liable to be dismissed on the ground that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is quite distinguishable from the Appellant's mark ""COBRA"", thus, qualifies for registration.
Subsequently, in January, 2014 it came to the Appellant's knowledge that Respondent No.2 in connivance with others had commenced their illegal activities of importing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and selling their goods in Karachi under the name and style of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", therefore, immediately upon becoming aware of such illegal activities, the Appellant filed Suit No.192/2014 against Respondent No.2 for infringement of rights, passing off, unfair competition, declaration and permanent injunction. In these proceedings vide order dated 03.02.2014 interim injunction was also passed, restraining Respondent No.2 from using mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". During the pendency of above suit and proceedings in Opposition No.455/2013, Appellant came to know that Respondent No.2 in the present appeal illegally obtained Trade Mark Registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", thereafter a detailed order was passed on 06.06.2014 in Suit No.192/2014, whereby the Appellant was required to file an application for invalidation of registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". Meanwhile, Respondent No.2 filed H.C.A. No.220/2014 against the order dated 06.06.2014 passed by the Single Bench in Suit No.192/2014 and the said order of Single Judge was suspended by the Division Bench vide its order dated 25.09.2014. The appeal was dismissed and the matter was remanded to the learned Single Judge to decide the injunction application in Suit No.192/2014. On 13.03.2017, an order was passed, whereby the registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was held as null and void and Respondent No.1 was directed to proceed with Opposition No.455/2013 and to pass a speaking order within thirty days. As a result thereof, the cancellation of the illegal registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing application No.280917 in class 5 was confirmed in Trade Marks Journal No.794 dated 01.03.2017. Opposition No.455/2013 came up for final hearing on 04.05.2017 before Respondent No.1 and subsequently on 10.08.2017 short order dated 07.08.2017 was communicated to the Appellant, disallowing the Opposition of the Appellant and allowing the application bearing No.280917 in class 5 of Respondent No.2 to proceed with registration with the disclaimer of word ""Cobra"" and all descriptive words/letters/device appearing on the label.
As the above order was received to the Appellant on 10.08.2017, they applied for certified copy of the decision, but the same was not communicated, hence they filed appeal only on the basis of short order communicated to them. However, subsequently, in compliance of Court's order dated 20.11.2017 detailed order was supplied to the parties, which is impugned by way of present appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed Counter Affidavit to this appeal and denied all the allegations/averments/statements made in the memorandum of titled appeal and supported the impugned order.
 in a different city.","It is contended by learned counsel for the Appellant that the impugned order has been passed, ignoring the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the provisions of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; in particular section 17 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been wrongly applied by Respondent No.1 while passing the order. Per learned counsel, the product bearing mark ""COBRA"" continued to be in use in Pakistan by the present Appellant since 1987 and the Appellant is the proprietor of the mark ""COBRA"" bearing Registration Nos.99323 and 106208 in classes 5 and 16 respectively; the earliest registration was obtained in the year 1988. The Respondent No.1 for arriving at the decision in respect of Opposition No.455/2013 has ignored and misconstrued the orders dated 13.02.2017, 20.02.2017 and 13.03.2017 passed by this Court in J.M. No.34/2014, wherein learned Judge clearly observed in the order that the trade mark registration was nearly identical, therefore, was in violation of the trade mark laws. This being the position, impugned decision passed by Respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
On the other hand, it is contended by learned counsel for Respondent No.2 that Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of import and for its products of insecticides had used trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", since year 2009. Per learned counsel, the Respondent's products under the Ordinance, 2001 referred to above are sold in Pakistan since 2009 onwards and expenditure of millions of rupees is incurred upon the advertisement of such products and it was well in knowledge of the Appellant since 2009, but they remained silent; neither objected nor otherwise filed any suit to restrain Respondent No.2 from using trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" and it is only in the month of February, 2014 after a delay of almost five years, they filed Suit No.192/2014 and obtained ex parte ad-interim injunction order in the suit, whereby Respondent No.2 was restrained from using its proprietor trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"".",For the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of Respondent No.1 is set aside and the Opposition No.455/2013 filed by the appellant is allowed. The application of Respondent No.2 bearing No.280917 is rejected.,"It is contended by learned counsel that the word ""COBRA"" per se is descriptive, suggestive and common to trade in relation to insecticides and herbicides; therefore, provisions of section 17 subject to provision of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001 are not applicable to the present case. They have got only registered their label and have not obtained any registration for the word ""COBRA"". Presently a larger number of competitors of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 are selling their insect killing products in various parts of the world including Pakistan using descriptive, suggestive and common to trade word ""COBRA"" and no confusion and deception has been caused to any person, therefore, in the light of above factual and legal position, Respondent No.1 has rightly passed the order, which has been impugned before this Court with wrong perception and ulterior motives. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following case law:
2013 CLD 330 (Tillotts Pharma AG v. GETZ Pharma (Private) Limited.)
1989 SCMR 361 (Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd.)
2007 CLD 991 (Messrs Master Textile Mills Ltd. v. Master Fabrics)
2007 CLD 997 (Abid Aziz Khan and 2 others v. Bank of Punjab).
Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 submitted that the order passed by Respondent No.1 has been passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the impugned order is valid and needs no interference at this stage.
Reasoning and Analysis
I have considered the arguments advanced before me by both the sides and have perused the case record.
To commence with, the material placed on record shows that so far as the claim of the Appellant as regards registration of trade mark ""COBRA"" and its prior use, disclosed in paragraphs two to five of the memo of appeal is concerned, it is an undeniable reality established on record; therefore, it needs no further discussion. Moreover, from the contents of earlier order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34/2014 it is also established that earlier certificate for registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing No.138268 dated 24.02.2014 in relation to trade mark No.280917 was issued by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 in blatant violation of the scheme of trade mark laws and thus declared null and void, which position was conceded before the Court by Respondent No.1 and not much disputed by Respondent No.2. In this background now it is to be seen that how far the subsequent impugned order dated 07.08.2017 passed by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 once again affirming the earlier stance (reasons recorded on 20.09.2017) is legal and within the frame work of the Ordinance, 2001. In this context firstly it is to be noted that purported prior use of trade mark ""COBRA"" by Respondent No.2 on the strength of earlier order of Respondent No.1, which was set aside by this Court vide order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34 of 2014 was nullity and void thus such period could not be considered by the Respondent No.1 as valid ground to justify the subsequent impugned order; observations of Respondent No.1 for this purpose are therefore ill-founded and perverse. Based on these facts there is no difficulty for me to hold that on one side the claim of Appellant regarding registration and use of trade mark ""COBRA"" is fully established and on the other side the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in the same category of goods is on weak footings, unless the Respondent No.2 could satisfy that use of prefix 'faster black' in their label before ""COBRA"" is sufficient to dislodge the opposition No.455 of 2013 filed by the Appellant. I have called for the samples of both the respective products from the learned counsel for the appellant and Respondent No.2 and by placing them in juxtaposition carefully examined the same, with reference to labels of ""COBRA"" and ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", and also the package material, size, shape, colour scheme and overall printed text. For ready reference their picture is placed below, which depicts similarities in the two products, sufficient to cause confusion among the ordinary customers.
The main guiding principle to examine the genuineness of the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for the registration of its trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is that upon comparison of the two, the Court is to be satisfied that there are sufficient features to differentiate between the two trade marks phonetically as well as visually, so that an unwary buyer of the same product, as in the instant matter, is genuinely not confused and misguided due to the feature of similarities between the two. In my considered opinion, the concept of totality of impression, test of average consumer etc. recorded by the Respondent No.1 in its order dated 20.09.2017 is misconceived and erroneous. As observed by me there are sound reasons disclosed by the Appellant in his Opposition No.455/2013, which justify grant of such opposition and consequent rejection of Application of 280917 in class 5 of registration of Trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in favour of Respondent No.2. This view of the matter is supported from the following judgments of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which are of binding nature:
PLD 1984 Supreme Court 8 (Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another).
PLD 1990 Supreme Court 313 (Seven-Up Company v. Kohinoor Thread Ball Factory and 3 others).

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and others---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28 of 2007, 6, 27, 81 of 2008 and 1 of 2009, decided on 25th July, 2018.","25th April, 2018.","KAUSAR SULTANA HUSSAIN, J.","Succinct the case of the appellant is that they filed applications before Registrar Trade Marks in accordance with the provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1940 and the Rules framed in pursuant to such Act, referred as Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963, such application were submitted prior to 12.04.2004 which is the date of coming into force of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, which was though promulgated on 14.04.2001, however in terms of section 1(3), the Ordinance had to take effect from a date to be notified in Official Gazette as reproduced below:-
(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 with an additional plaintiff.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

","F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020, decided on 26th February, 2021.","3rd February, 2021.
JUDGMENT
","GHULAM AZAM QAMBRANI, J.","Brief facts necessary for adjudication of this appeal are that the appellant filed a suit for perpetual injunction against infringement of registered trade mark against the defendants contending therein that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 entered into a partnership agreement at Islamabad on 28.11.2013, forming a Firm in the name and style of ""Messrs Zakori International"" with its office at Murree Road, Rawalpindi; that the said Firm was duly registered with Registrar of Firms Rawalpindi under the partnership Act; that after establishing Messrs Zakori International, the appellant/plaintiff became busy in his other business ventures abroad. The appellant/plaintiff had to act as a dormant partner of Messrs Zakori International, hence he reposed his complete trust in respondent/defendant No.1 on the basis of family relationship and past association; that respondent No.1 was running all the day to day affairs of the Firm since beginning and all the record of business and accounts was in his control. However, as per business needs, the appellant/plaintiff used to inject capital in the business as required by respondent No.1; that bank account of Messrs Zakori International was also operated by respondent No.1, who was also having control over the business of Messrs Zakori International and the appellant/plaintiff had complete trust and confidence in him; that Messrs Zakori international is currently operating two successful brands i.e. Mr. COD with 22 branches across Pakistan, two in Afghanistan and one in Bahrain and Ranchers, an indigenous brand of Zakori International having two branches one in the Rawalpindi and the other in Islamabad; that trade mark Ranchers has been registered jointly in the name of respondent/defendant No.1 and the appellant/plaintiff under section 33(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 by the Registrar of Trade Mark vide No.401490 dated 06.11.2015, which means that all the Intellectual property rights relating to the Ranchers are vested in Zakori International, which in equal shares, is jointly owned by the appellant/plaintiff and respondent No.1; that despite the fact that the appellant and respondent No.1 were joint owners of the registered trade mark namely ""Ranchers"", respondent No.1 initiated the process of granting master franchising rights of Ranchers to respondent No.2 without obtaining prior consent from the appellant by executing a Joint ventures partnership agreement for Ranchers the J.V agreement was made on 01.04.2017, at Islamabad. The grievance of the appellant is that respondent No.1 without consent of the plaintiff and in violation of the partnership deed dated 28.11.2013, is executing joint venture partnership agreement of ""Ranchers"" with defendant No.2, through defendant No.3 in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; that signing of the joint agreement by defendant No.1 with defendant No.2 without consent and approval of plaintiff constitutes infringement of registered trade mark of plaintiff within the meaning of section 40(5) read with section 46 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. with new evidence presented.",The main proposition falling for determination is as to whether the learned Tribunal has the jurisdiction or not.,"For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order does not call for any interference at this end, hence the appeal is devoid of any substance, therefore, the same is dismissed.","Here the question arises that whether mere usage of registered trademark belonging to a person by another person constitutes infringement and whether that usage need to be necessarily in the course of trade and whether usage of trade mark while executing any agreement constitutes infringement. The contention of the appellant side is that agreement between defendants Nos.1 and 2 has been executed in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, therefore, the same constitutes an infringement within the meaning of section 40(5) of the Ordinance, ibid, and accordingly the same is actionable under section 46(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, meaning thereby that according to section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, the defendant ought to physically use the trade mark of the plaintiff in the course of trade for constituting any infringement. In the instant case, the situation seems to be entirely different because the trade mark partially owned by the plaintiff has not been used, as yet, therefore, there is no question of infringement by the defendants in the course of trade.
10. A careful examination of the record reveals that the instant suit has been filed only on account of signing of an agreement between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 and the stage of use of the trade mark has not yet reached. According to the contents of the plaint, defendant No.1, who is the joint owner of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" with the plaintiff is assigning the registered trade mark to defendant No.2 through an agreement dated 01.04.2017 without seeking the approval of plaintiff being the co-owner of the trade mark, in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The plaintiff while considering this action of defendant No.1 as an infringement of his registered trade mark has filed the instant suit. Thus the actual dispute is between co-owners of the trade mark and the plaintiff has filed the instant suit to restrain his co-owner i.e. defendant No.1 from entering into a franchise agreement of the trademark with defendant No.2. This Court has failed to find any express provision in the Trade Marks Ordinance, which prohibits a co-owner of a trade mark to enter into an agreement qua the subject trade mark with anyone else. Similarly, there is no provision in the Ordinance, ibid, which empowers a co-owner to file a suit against the other co-owner qua the issue of infringement. Similarly, there is no denial of the fact that any violation of section 24(5) read with section 69 of the Trade Marks Ordinance falls within the jurisdiction of a District Court under section 117 of the Trade Mark Ordinance and, as such, the Tribunal cannot adjudicate upon a controversy between the co-owners of the trade mark.
11. The next proposition, which boils down for determination is whether a dispute of partnership between the co-owners of a trade mark can be settled by the Tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction within the meaning of section 18 of the IPO Act. This court has carefully attended this aspect of the matter. Prior to the IPO Act 2012 all civil suits/proceedings regarding protection of intellectual property rights were filed before the District Judge under section 117 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The relevant Section of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is reproduced hereunder in verbatim:-
""Suits for infringement to be instituted before District Court. No suit for the infringement of a trade mark or otherwise relating to any right in a trade mark shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.""

BAYHEALTH CARE (PRIVATE) LIMITED through Chief Executive Director, Company Secretary and another---Defendants

"," 
Suit No. 727 of 2008, decided on 27th May, 2013.",,,"The plaintiffs have filed this suit against defendant No.1 for accounts, recovery of money, damages, and perpetual and mandatory injunctions. Before dealing with the case of the plaintiffs, it is necessary to trace their background and to understand the circumstances in which they were constrained to file the present Suit.
 Plaintiff No.1 BAYER AG, which is an international chemical and pharmaceutical company incorporated and based in the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling a variety of products, as well as providing services in diverse areas such as health care, agrochemical products, organic products, specialty chemicals, industrial products, engineering materials, etc. The business and operations of plaintiff No.1 are spread almost all over the world. Plaintiff No.1 is the owner of the name 'BAYER' since 1-8-1863, when the founder of plaintiff No.1 Mr. Fredrich Bayer started his business in the name and style 'Friedr'. Bayer et comp' in partnership with one Mr. Fredrich Weskott. The partnership was converted into a joint stock company in the year 1981 in the name and style 'Farbenfabriken vorm Friedr Bayer & Co.' Plaintiff No.1 entered into the pharmaceutical business in the year 1888, for which it is well known and acknowledged throughout the world, including Pakistan. In the year 1904, plaintiff No.1 developed, adopted and started using its corporate image, the Bayer Cross Logo, wherein the word 'BAYER' appears vertically as well as horizontally within a circle, and the words intersect at the letter 'Y'. The name of plaintiff No.1 was changed in the year 1972 to its present name, that is, 'BAYER AG'. Plaintiff No.2 'Bayer HealthCare AG' is a wholly owned subsidiary of plaintiff No.1.
 In addition to their company name 'Bayer', the principal trademark 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, the plaintiffs also coined/developed/created various 'Bay' Formative Marks, that are being used by them in their pharmaceutical products all over the world. It has been claimed by the plaintiffs that the word 'Bayer' is in their exclusive use since 1863 as their trade name, company name, trademark, service mark and house mark, which as well as the Bayer Cross Logo, appear on all their products, product packaging, buildings, structures, stationery and vehicles. The plaintiffs have also claimed that they have been using 'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' as their trademarks/company names/trade names, and the Bayer Cross Logo as their logo, and in all their printed and audio-visual promotions and advertisements in Pakistan during the past several years, they have prominently and extensively used their trademarks/company names/trade names/'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE'. The plaintiffs have further claimed that the word 'Bayer' has never been used by or associated with anyone else throughout the world. Because of the use of the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks exclusively by the plaintiffs, and their extensive promotions and advertisements by them, the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks have acquired not only substantial reputation and goodwill in Pakistan, but have also created strong awareness in the general public that all the above are associated only with the plaintiffs, and all products with the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks thereon, belong exclusively to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have averred that they have been carrying on their pharmaceutical business in Pakistan for several decades in the name and style Bayer Pakistan (Private) Limited, a Pakistani subsidiary/sister concern of plaintiff No.1, which uses several trademarks of plaintiff No.1 in Pakistan, including the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, under the authority and supervision of plaintiff No.1. In order to protect their interests in their trademark 'Bayer' and 'Bay' Formative Marks, the plaintiffs have obtained their registration in Pakistan. The sale figures of the plaintiffs' products in Pakistan run into hundreds of millions of Rupees every year.
It is the case of the plaintiffs that all their products manufactured, sold and marketed in Pakistan depict the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, and in addition to the above, various pharmaceutical products bearing the marks derived from the prefix 'Bay', that is, 'Bay' Formative Marks, such as 'LIPOBAY' and 'GLUCOBAY', are being sold in Pakistan since 1991, when the said products were got registered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are also using the trademark 'BAYCUTEN' with the prefix 'Bay' in Pakistan since 1991, and the said product is still being sold. Another trademark 'BAYDAL' with the prefix 'Bay' has been recently introduced in Pakistan by the plaintiffs, and they intend to introduce in future more products in Pakistan with 'Bay' Formative Marks.
The plaintiffs have stated that in November 2007, they came to know through an advertisement in the Trade Marks Journal No.681 dated 1-10-2007, published on 31-10-2007, that defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' had filed applications with the Registrar of Copyrights for registration of trademarks 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS', as copyright. It has been alleged that, defendant No.1 had adopted and started using the aforementioned imitated 'Bay' Formative Marks in an unauthorized and mala fide manner. Through the said applications filed by defendant No.1, the plaintiffs also came to know that defendant No.1 had been incorporated as a company in the above name and style. It has been strongly alleged by the plaintiffs that, by using the prefix 'Bay' in its name and the purported trademarks, defendant No.1 has attempted to take undue advantage of the plaintiffs' well known and reputed trademark, service mark, company name and trade name, that is, 'Bayer', Bayer Cross Logo and 'Bay' Formative Marks.
 with contradictory witness statements.","After carefully examining two authorities and the other reported cases, I feel that there is hardly anything that can be added to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court or the findings given by other Superior Courts for determining the criteria as to whether or not a case falls under the definition of infringement or passing off. As I have understood, in a case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has infringed his trademark, copyright or trade name, it is to be gauged as to whether or not the products of the plaintiff and the defendant are identical, or to what extent they are similar. The products, without any investigation or close examination, should look identical or similar in size, shape, colour/colour scheme, texture, packing, presentation, or appearance, so as to deceive the customer/consumer to purchase/use the product of the defendant without any hesitation or doubt in his mind, under the impression that he has purchased/used the product of the plaintiff. It is not necessary that the defendant's product should have all the above characteristics to look similar or identical to the product of the plaintiff; any one, or some of them, may be sufficient in some cases to create such a situation. If the customer/consumer gets deceived or becomes doubtful or confused after looking at or comparing the products of the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff will be justified in bringing an action against the defendant. In my opinion, it is not necessary that the deception or confusion was caused by the defendant deliberately or intentionally, and even unintentional deception and confusion in such cases would give rise to a cause of action to the plaintiff, as the main element is the deception and/or confusion, and not the intention of the person responsible for the deception and/or confusion. The above aspect becomes more important and applicable when the plaintiff and the defendant are operating and carrying on business in the same area/field, the nature of their business is the same or similar, and the operations and business of the plaintiff were prior in time to those of the defendant. I am also of the view that when a person, firm or company decides to start the business in a particular name and style or with a particular trademark or copyright, he/they are duty-bound to ascertain and ensure that the name and style or the trademark or copyright which they intend to use, was not being used by any other entity. If such caution is not exercised and any infringement and/or passing off is caused, the entire responsibility as to the consequences shall rest on the person/entity who uses the same or similar name and style, trademark or copyright that was already in the use of or was already owned by the other entity.","In view of the above discussion and findings, and also as the plaintiffs have successfully proven their case, the Suit is decreed with costs against defendant No.1 to the extent of Prayers (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vii) made in paragraph 26 of the plaint, and Prayers (a) and (b) made in paragraph 26.1 of the plaint, as prayed by the plaintiffs. It is hereby ordered that defendant No.1 shall immediately take all necessary steps for changing/rectifying its name in the record of defendant No.2 by ensuring that the company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, belonging to and owned by the plaintiffs, are deleted/removed from the name of defendant No.1 with immediate effect. The entire exercise shall be completed by defendant No.1 within thirty (30) days hereof. Defendant No.2, the Deputy Registrar of Companies, SECP, Karachi, is hereby directed that in case defendant No.1 does not initiate the above process or the said process is not completed within the stipulated time frame, defendant No.2 shall ensure that the registration of defendant No.1 in its present imitated name is cancelled, and the rectification in the defendant No.1's name is carried out in the above terms in letter and spirit. Defendant No.2 is further directed to submit the compliance report to this Court through the M.I.T. within one week after the expiration of the stipulated period.
The office is directed to forward copies of this judgment to the M.I.T., as well as to defendant No.2 and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad, for compliance.","In the present case, the plaintiffs have successfully established that they are the lawful owners of their company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, and the 'Bayer' Logo. The comparison and a bare perusal of the defendant No.1's name as well as the names of its products show that the prefix 'Bay' and the 'Bay' Formative Marks owned by the plaintiffs, have been used therein by defendant No.1 in a glaring and obvious manner. The name of defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' encompasses not only the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs, but also the words 'health Care', which are the part and parcel of the trade mark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' owned by the plaintiffs. Likewise, the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs distinctly, prominently and unambiguously appears in the products 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS' manufactured, sold and marketed by defendant No.1. The above similarities are of such nature that they can go unnoticed, undetected and unchecked very easily, and the same are bound to cause deception or confusion in the minds of the customers/consumers, doctors, retailers, dealers, stockists, etc., that the imitated products of defendant No.1 are those of the plaintiffs, especially when all the imitated products of defendant No.1 with its imitated name thereon, and those of the plaintiffs, are sold, marketed, used and consumed as pharmaceutical products. The similarities between the trademarks and the company/trade names of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1, are so obvious and unambiguous that because of the use of the plaintiff's prefix 'Bay' and the word 'healthCare' of the plaintiffs' trademark by defendant No.1, its products and the plaintiffs' products look identical. As such, no inquiry. or investigation is required to compare or distinguish the products. My above observations clearly show that this is a case of infringement of the plaintiff's trademarks and company/trade names by defendant No.1, and that of passing off its goods, business and services as those of the plaintiffs, especially in view of Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold that if the two marks are absolutely identical, no further probe is needed and infringement is established.
Regarding the prayer made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and the prayer for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present name of defendant No.1, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh and Sons Ltd. and another v. Azhar Wali Muhammad and 11 others, 1986 MLD 1870. In view of the cases of Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh & Sons Ltd. and Messrs ADT Services AG (supra), it is clear that the prayers made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present imitated name of defendant No.1, can be granted by this Court.
Subsection (2) of section 37 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, provides as under:--

""(2) A company shall not be registered by a name identical with that by which a company in existence is already registered, or so nearly resembling that name as to be calculated to deceive, except where the company in existence is in the course of being dissolved and signifies its consent in such manner as the registrar requires.""

In view of this mandatory provision in the Companies Ordinance, 1984, the name of defendant No.1 ought not have been entertained or registered by the Deputy Registrar concerned, as the company/trade name of defendant No.1 contains the plaintiffs' company/trade name, the trademark as well as the prefix 'Bay' Formative Marks. For the same reason, the Registrar Trademarks ought not have entertained or registered the products of defendant No.1. Both the above named authorities failed in discharging their statutory functions and duties in accordance with law. If these authorities perform their functions and duties vigilantly and in a prudent manner, the possibility of infringement and passing off can be curbed to a great extent, and unnecessary inconvenience and loss to parties as well as uncalled for litigation could be avoided.

","First Appeal from Order No.213 of 2012, decided on 28th September, 2012.",,,"Appellant herein is a public limited company and claims to be the creator, originator, owner and user of trademark ""P"" in stylized form (hereafter stylized ""P"" logo) which it claims to be using since the inception of its business of cement manufacturing, marketing and selling for more than two decades. It claims to have launched a new brand of cement for export to Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics with the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device. It is claimed that cement bags with the said trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device were designed and printed for the appellant first time by a company called Syntronics Limited in May 2010.
The appellant claims to have engaged respondent No.3, a Pakistani company having its office in Peshawar as its distributor and submits that respondent No.3, as a distributor of the appellant, entered into a contract with an Afghan company named Shirkat-ul-Faisal and started exporting cement to Afghanistan under the trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device. It is alleged that after some time relationship between the appellant and respondent No.3 came to an end, whereafter respondent No.3 contracted appellant's competitor, respondent No.1, and started exporting cement to Shirakat-ul-Faisal in Afghanistan under appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device in utter disregard of law and violation of business ethics and with dishonesty and mala fide.
To restrain respondents from using the aforesaid trademark, the appellant filed a suit for infringement coupled with passing off the goods before the learned District Judge, Lahore, along with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. and the learned Additional District Judge granted a restraining order on 24th June, 2011 which was withdrawn through the impugned order dated 29-3-2012. 
The respondents resisted the suit and inter alia challenged the claim of proprietorship of the trademark by the appellant. Certain allegations about concealment of some facts concerning dealership were also raised and it was also asserted that Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited has obtained registration of Two Elephants device in Afghanistan. Strong reliance by the respondents was placed on obtaining trademark registration in Afghanistan by Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited in Afghanistan. with contradictory witness statements.","Whether the appellant is the prior user and owner of the disputed trademark comprising the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device and whether the respondents' use of the trademark constitutes infringement and passing off.","In the light of the above, this appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned order dated 29-3-2012, is set aside. The respondents are restrained to use the appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device till the final disposal of the suit. It is however noted that the observations made above are tentative in nature and would not influence the decision of the suit on merits after recording of evidence. As valuable rights of parties are involved it is ordered that the trial Court shall decide the suit within six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.","If Do Pheel/Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, a Director of respondent No.3, it seems inconceivable that they would continue to use it with stylized ""P"" logo, as stylized ""P"" logo is admittedly the trademark of appellant. This, prima facie, shows dishonesty on the part of the respondents. In this respect even if, for argument's sake, it is considered that Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, then if, as per respondent's own stance that their dealership was unlawfully cancelled by the appellant, it was their legal, moral and ethical duty to have only taken their alleged Two Elephants device trademark to respondents Nos.1 and 2 (Fecto Cement Limited) to start export with Two Elephants device replacing appellant's stylized ""P"" logo with that of Fecto's own logo. This was apparently not done for obvious reasons that respondents desired to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" logo as a trademark of the appellant by virtue of its use on cement exported to Afghanistan.
There is a further aspect to respondents' prima facie dishonest act and their efforts to deceive the Courts. If Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4 (Mr. S. Mehtab Hussain), a Director of respondent No.3, then it is not understandable why they would allow Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited, which is a separate entity, to register it in its name in Afghanistan and not in the name of the said respondent or respondent No.3. 
As far as Distributorship is concerned it is pertinent to note that respondents in their written statement have admitted the existence of distributorship and have referred to it as well as attached a copy of said letter in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Factual Matrix of the written statement as reproduced below:--

(1) That the plaintiff approached defendant(s) Nos.3 and 4 in order to subscribe to their services as exclusive and sole distributor(s)/dealer(s). The plaintiff, at all material times, represented and assured that defendant No.3 would be engaged to the exclusion of all others. It is submitted that Dho Pheel/(the two elephants) was the brainchild of defendant No.4, who is and was at all material times, the Director of defendant No.3.

(2) That the plaintiff through its General Manager (Marketing and Sales), Mr. Rizwari Butt, confirmed the appointment of defendant No.4 as the authorized Sole Distributor for Afghanistan and CARs (Central Asian Republics) through a letter dated 29-3-2010. A copy of the letter dated 29-3-2010 is placed herewith as Annex-E.

(3) That the albeit it is beyond the scope of the present proceedings, it is nevertheless the case that the plaintiff flagrantly breached the Dealership Agreement, which it had struck with defendant No.3. Consequently, the latter, on the plaintiff's contractual repudiation, was but only impelled to enter into a Dealership Agreement dated 20-4-2011 with defendant No.1 (viz, Fecto Cement Limited). A copy of an email written by defendant No.4 to the General Manager of defendant No.1 substantiating these state of affairs is placed herewith as Annex -F.
The learned trial Court has stated the correct principle that in trademark cases most important factor is who is prior user of trademark. This principle is in particular applicable when none of the contesting parties is armed with a registered trademark. Despite stating the correct principle, in my humble view, the learned trial Judge committed a serious error when he concluded that the plaintiff company (appellant) did not produce any cogent and convincing material in this regard. This apparently reflects that the learned trial Judge did not pay much attention to the pleadings of the parties nor perused the documents available on the record. 
In the present case, there is admittance on the part of the respondents that respondent No.3 has acted as a distributor for the appellant and sold appellant's cement with the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device to Afghanistan. Therefore, there is no denial or challenge that the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device was not first used by the appellant and cement with this trademark was not sold in Afghanistan through respondent No.3 as a distributor of appellant and thus there is no denial that appellant is the prior user of the disputed trademark.
In my humble opinion the distributor's appointment letter and above admitted facts were sufficient to, prima facie, show that appellant was the prior user and prior owner of the Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" trademark for cement. Moreover the respondents have not explained the reason for their choice to use the stylized ""P"" logo along with Two Elephants, when respondent No.1 itself seems to be a well known company, it should have chosen to use its own independent logo and not that of its competitors. It is in particular not appreciable that big business groups resort to copying their competitors trademarks, as, prima facie, seems to be the case here.
In the light of the above, it clearly appears that the appellant has made out a prima facie case in its favour and is likely to suffer irreparable loss if the respondents are not restrained from using the stylized ""P"" logo and the Two Elephants device. I must add here that trademark rights are lifelines of businesses and unauthorized use of owner's trademark by third parties results in un-quantifiable loss and damage to its goodwill and business which is irreparable in nature. Thus the loss that the appellant is likely to suffer as a result of use of appellant's trademark by the respondents cannot be calculated in terms of monetary compensation and would be irreparable in nature. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the appellant. I must also observe that under section 46(2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 all such reliefs by way of damages, injunction, accounts are available to the proprietor of a trademark simultaneously and not as an alternate to each other and just because in addition to interim injunction a plaintiff may claim damages and compensation in a suit relating to trademark rights, interim relief cannot be denied on that ground.

","High Court Appeal No. 244 of 2014, decided on 18th March, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Being aggrieved by the order dated 16 September, 2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.752 of 2014, disposing of the injunction application in favour of the present Respondent and restraining the Appellant from using the trade mark ""Shield and Device of Shield"", holding it identical and deceptively similar with the trade mark ""Health Shield plus Device of Shield"" of the Plaintiff, the instant appeal has been filed.
While the learned Single Judge has dealt the matter at length in the impugned order, snapshot of the controversy is that the Respondent who is a leading national entity engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling goods related to toothpaste, toothbrushes and baby care products since 1974 and, as claimed by his counsel and as per the copies of numerous trade mark registration certificates attached along with his counter, has obtained registration of the said trade mark, which acts as a house mark, in respect of all goods/services falling in Class-1 to Class 45 of the International Classification of Goods and Services under the Nice agreement (applicable in Pakistan also), notwithstanding that the business of the Respondent doesn't fall in more than a few classes of goods, in particular, class 3 for toothpaste, class 21 for toothbrushes, and class 10 for baby feeders and alike baby products.
On the other hand, the Appellant is a manufacturer and one of the most renowned vegetable ghee and cooking oil brand in the country taking the inception from pre-partition days and enjoys immense household reputation in relation to their goods i.e. Banaspati Ghee and Vegetable Oils, falling in Class 29. due to a change in law.","To us, beside what has been settled in the above paragraph, the present controversy revolves around two basic elements:
(i) A trader while in the business of selected range of goods registers his trade mark in respect of all or a large number of classes of goods/services and uses the said instrument of registration certificate to restrain other traders from using a portion of his trade mark in respect of goods which the former has never manufactured and seeks to restrain the latter from using the portion of his trade mark in relation to goods which are of prime commercial interest to the latter; and
(ii) In what circumstances a trade mark can be held to be confusedly similar with another trade mark?
The answer to the second point is buried in piles of cases dating back centuries where courts have established the test of comparing two trade marks. These tests have been over and over used in numerous cases including those decided by courts in Pakistan. Briefly speaking the courts have come to the conclusion that while comparing as to deceptive similarity of two trade mark, the test known as Classic Trinity requires courts to consider following three aspects:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.","Thus, in the instant case, on account of the foregoing considerations, we come to the conclusion that the allegations of the Respondent are completely flawed on all the above discussed accounts, and the Appellant has legit reasons to continue to use its impugned trade mark. These are the reasons for the short order passed on 24.02.2016 allowing this appeal and dismissing the injunction application filed in the Suit No. 752/2014.","In order to give a face to the controversy, we find it prudent to reproduce the two contesting trade marks in the following:
Appellant's Trade Mark Respondent's Trade Mark
Also of relevance, is the manner in which these trade marks are used on their respective products; which we reproduce as under:
Appellant's Product Sample Respondent's Product Sample
There is a difference between the use of a mark (or sign) ordinarily and use of a mark as a trade mark. While a mark could be any graphical representation of a visually perceivable item on the packaging of a product (in the instant case), and the consumer connects it with the source of the goods. In other words when a mark (or sign) is used as a trade mark, it starts connecting products (or services) to their respective sources and origins and the customer uses the said mark when choosing a particular product, or when refusing another product instead. The manufacturer of Dalda cooking oil decides to remove the said Health Shield sign from its packaging, it will not affect distinctiveness of trade mark Dalda and the customer will always reach out and choose Dalda as their choice of product, in this example. This is the key difference between a mark (or sign) and a trade mark.
In the instant case, it is admitted that the Respondent has reputation and goodwill in its trade mark, however, such reputation and goodwill is only limited to the goods falling in Classes 3, 21 and 10, being toothbrushes, toothpastes, baby feeders and allied baby products. With regards, part 2, ""misrepresentation"" made by the Appellant, it can also be seen by looking at the complete packaging of the Appellant's product (as reproduced in paragraph 5), that no attempt has been made by the Appellant to misrepresent or disguise itself as the Respondent or to sail close to the Respondent. Applying the ""Moron In A Hurry"" test in the instant case, we tend to agree that even a moron in a hurry will not pick a bottle of Dalda cooking oil instead of Shield toothpaste, even if his last train is leaving for home in the next 5 minutes, on a Friday night.
With regards the third part of classic trinity, there is no iota in our mind that when products of both the parties are so different in nature, sold to different customer-needs, kept at different locations in shops (usually); a case of actual damage or loss to the Respondent on account of Appellant's use of the impugned trade mark could be imagined even. Therefore without taking any further time, we can safely conclude that the classic trinity test passes in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondent.
a trade mark is a badge of origin, the grant of a registration certificate is made to the person who uses (or honestly proposes to use) a trade mark in the course of trade to the benefit of customers so that the customers can distinguish the said trader's goods apart from other competitors' products. A trade mark registration certificate is thus a seal imposed by the Government certifying that goods manufactured (or sold) under the said trade mark will only and legitimately be sourced by the person in whose name the trade mark is registered. The concept of purity of trade mark register hinges to the idea that trade marks which are not used by their respective owners, shall be removed from the register of trade marks since possession of the registration certificate without active commercial use of the trade mark negates the very purpose of trade mark legislation.
By stretching beyond the umbrella provided, the legislation intends to mean that the person who has registered a trade mark is threatening infringement thereof when the defendant is (a) not using the identical trade mark; or (b) not in the course of trade; and (c) not using the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services. It could be thus seen that the act of the Appellant does not come anywhere inside the triangle created by these three pillars, therefore no infringement of the registered trade mark of the Respondent has been established.
As a last round, the counsel for the Respondent contended the act of the Appellant is causing ""dilution"" of the Respondent's trade mark. While, at the first hand, since the mark of the Respondent is allegedly registered in class 29, therefore a better claim (as already raised by it) ought to be of infringement, rather than of dilution. While there is no global list of well-known trade marks, but Coca-Cola; Google; Apple; McDonalds; Microsoft; IBM; Citibank; Boeing; Toyota are said to qualify such a list. With regards national trade marks, without prejudice, we are of the opinion, and such list could include trade marks like Mobilink, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, which on the basis of their immense reputation and goodwill, could be protected from unauthorized use on non-competing goods and services. Therefore to allege the 'dilution' claim, the Respondent has to prove the highest degree of fame required under section 86, to which in our opinion, trade mark of the Respondent SHIELD does not rise.

WELLA AKTINEESELLSCHAFT---Appellant
 
versus
 
SHAMIM AKHTAR and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Appeals Nos.861 to 863 of 2002, decided on 24th April, 2015.",,,"The facts leading to the present litigation may be succinctly put forth as follows. The appellant Messrs Wella Aktineesellschaft, is a company registered under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing and exporting cosmetic items etc. On 19-7-1971, the appellant got registered two marks, ""WELLAFORM"" (word) and ""WELLAFLEX"" (word), bearing registration numbers 55811 and 55812, respectively. Additionally, the appellants already had the registered trademark in respect of ""WELLA with Device"", bearing registration number 8376, dated 28-9-1949 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""Trade marks""). The aforesaid Trademarks were all registered under Class - 3, as being ""soap, perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, products for cleaning, conditioning and embellishing the hair, including hair shampoos, dry shampoos, hair lotions, hair dressing creams, hair care products, hair sprays, permanent waving solutions, bleaching preparations, neutralizing agents, hair dyes, hair colouring products, hair fixing preparations, hair toning preparations, hair setting lotions"". The appellant also duly applied for the renewal of ""WELLAFORM"" and ""WELLAFLEX"" trademarks, which were renewed up till 19-7-1993. With respect to the trade mark ""WELLA with device"", their registration was also renewed from 28-9-1986 up till 28-9-2001.
 
The appellant, however, could not freely sell their products in Pakistan, in relation to which these Trademarks were registered, from the year 1979 to 1985 due to ban on the import of these products as per the Import Policy Orders 1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan.
 
As it transpires from the record the respondent No. 1, which is claimed to be a partnership concern carrying on the business of manufacturing and trading in cosmetics and allied products, as per their claim started using the trademark ""WELLA"" since the year 1984 and subsequently applied for its registration through T.M.A. No. 87457 in Class-3, which application for registration met with an objection that the Trademarks of the appellant, bearing Nos. 8376 (""Wella with Device""), 55811 (""WELLAFORM"") and 55812 (""WELLAFLEX"") conflicted with the trademark ""WELLA"" sought to be registered. Thus, on 9-8-1986, respondent No. 1, filed rectification applications bearing numbers 17/86, 18/86 and 19/86, regarding ""WELLAFORM"", ""WELLAFLEX"" and ""WELLA with device"", respectively, before respondent No. 2, seeking expunction of these registered Trademarks, as according to respondent No. 1, the appellant had registered these Trademarks without any bona fide intention to use them in relation to the goods falling in class-3 and had in fact failed to use them since their registration.
 with new technological evidence.","whether ""special circumstance"" existed in a case which justified non-user of the mark by the registered proprietor within the meaning of section 37(3) of the Act is to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case. The important factor however, to be kept in mind while deciding the above fact is whether the actual non-user of the trade mark resulted on account of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor to abandon the mark or on account of certain other factor which would amount to special circumstances for such non-user. Here, again, while considering the other factors, it is not merely the attendant or attached circumstance to any particular individual business which is relevant but a special circumstances of the kind which affects or applies to all the traders in that particular trade. 
Conversely, Mr. Arshad Ali Chaudhry, learned Advocate Supreme Court for respondent No.1 contended that it is an admitted position from the case record that the three Registered Trademarks, regarding which respondent No.1 had moved applications under section 37(1)(b) (ibid) against the appellant, were registered in their favour on 28-9-1949, 19-7-1971 and 19-7-1971, respectively, but in Pakistan there was no use of these trademarks by the appellant Company throughout the subsequent period. Thus, the conclusion recorded by the respondent No.2 in his order dated 21-9-1988, as upheld by the High Court in its impugned judgment dated 19-4-2006, is based on proper appreciation of facts and correct interpretation of law.","The upshot of above discussion is that the High Court in its impugned judgment as well as the Registrar/respondent No.2, in his orders dated 21-9-1988, wrongly invoked the provisions of section 37(1)(b) of the Act of 1940 for ordering removal of registered trademarks of the appellant.
Foregoing are the reasons for our short order dated 24-4-2015, passed in these appeals, which reads as under:-
""Having heard the arguments of the learned ASC for both the parties, for the reasons to follow separately, these appeals are allowed, the impugned judgment and the three orders dated 21-9-1988, passed by respondent No.2 are set aside, Resultantly, Rectification Cases Nos.17, 18 and 19 of 1986 are dismissed and the registered trademarks of the appellant are restored.""
 
","Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use:---(1) Subject to the provisions of section 33, a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application in the prescribed manner by any person aggrieved to a High Court or to the Registrar, on the ground either-
 
(a) That the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or, in a case to which the provisions of section 36 apply, by the company concerned, and that there has in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of the application; or 
(b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application, a continuous period of five years or longer elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being:
 
Provided that, except where the applicant has been permitted under subsection (2) of section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the Tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark, the Tribunal may refuse an application made under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods, if it is shown that there has been, before the relevant date or during the relevant period, as the case may be, bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description, being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
 
(2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered:
(a) the circumstances referred to in clause (b) of subsection (1) are shown to exist so far as regards non- use of the trade mark in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in a particular place in Pakistan (otherwise than for export from Pakistan), or in relation to goods to be exported to a particular market outside Pakistan; and
(b) a person has been permitted under subsection (2) of section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under a registration extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold, or otherwise traded in, or in relation to goods to be so exported, or the Tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,
 
on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar, the Tribunal may impose on the registration of the first mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use.
An applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of subsection (1) or of subsection (2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates.""A careful reading of the above reproduced provision of law qua the scheme of the Act of 1940 reveals that it is a penal provision aimed to work as deterrent for those, seeking Registration of any trademark under the Act of 1940 with some ulterior motive, which they do not intend to use or there had been in fact no bona fide use of their trademark in relation to those goods for a specified period. But for seeking the relief of removal/revocation of a registered trademark under section 37(1)(b) (ibid), specific minimum timeframe of five years has been provided during which there had been no bona fide use of such trademark by its proprietor, which is to be computed from a date one month before the date of application submitted by any aggrieved person in this regard. In the present case, as mentioned earlier, the three identical applications under sections 37, 38 and 46 of the Act of 1940 were submitted by respondent No.1 for seeking removal of registered trademarks of the appellant on 9-8-1986, precisely, with the same assertions that there was no bona fide use thereof from the side of appellant for a period of over five years by that time and since the year 1984, Trademark ""WELLA"" was honestly used by the respondent No.1, thus, the three registered trademarks Nos.8376, 55811 and 55812 in class-3 of the registered trademarks were prejudicial to their interest and liable to be removed/cancelled.
Looking to the case of respondent No.1 for grant of requisite relief, claimed by them in their applications under section 37 of the Act of 1940, submitted before respondent No.2, it is also relevant to mention that in the year 1984 for the first time they had started using the trademark ""WELLA"" for their products under class-3, when the three registered trademarks of the appellant were already in field for a considerable long period. In such circumstances, mere assertion of respondent No.1 that adoption of such trade mark was after due search undertaken by them and bona fide, is not free from serious doubts. More so, in the circumstances when no material in support of such plea was placed on record and the trademarks of the appellant were well known and recognized internationally. It may also be added here that the burden of proof regarding the two material facts, (a) whether there was no bona fide use of the Registered Trademarks by the appellant for a continuous period of five years upto a date one month before the date of the application without any lawful excuse or special circumstances as envisaged under section 37(3) ibid, and (b) whether the attempt of respondent No.1 for seeking registration of word ""WELLA"" as their trademark was bona fide, was squarely upon respondent No.1, which was to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, so as to invoke its penal consequences against the appellant, but, as discussed above, they failed to discharge.
In addition to it, the observations of respondent No.2, contained in his orders dated 21-9-1988, that in case of ban on goods in class-3 under the import policies issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan for the years 1981-82 to 1984- 85, the appellant could have appointed some registered user under section 39 of the Act of 1940, or they could have assigned their trademark by invoking section 28 of the Act of 1940, or granted license to some person to avoid the penal consequences of section 37(1)(b) ibid, are equally without force as the Act of 1940 does not envisage any such compulsion to avoid the consequence of Government ban, which could be justly and fairly considered as special circumstances in the trade within the meaning of section 37(3) ibid and not to any intention of appellant to abandon or not to use their trade marks.

","Civil Original No. 1161 of 2015, decided on 10th December, 2018.","10th December, 2018.","SHAHID KARIM, J.","The facts are simple and may be stated shortly. The parties are on common ground with regard to a substantial portion of the facts. The applicant is a company registered under the laws of Kingdom of Thailand and is a global distributor of the world's leading cosmetics brands including but not limited to Tellme, Nature Bright, Sunway. Lawland, Effi'n, Elfi'. Promina cover Art and Arche'. The applicant is a worldwide agent of Arche products and its various brands of cosmetics which include Arche' Pure Thai Pearl Cream, Arche' White and Brite, Arche' White Pearl Cream etc. Paragraph 4 of the petition gives a list of the countries and the detail of the registration of Arche trade mark in the name of the applicant. In short, the applicant is the exclusive owner of the trade mark `Arche' and on this basis establishes its right over the intellectual property relating to Arche. The respondent No.3 is the authorized agent of the applicant in Pakistan and is responsible for marketing, selling or exporting its products in Pakistan. The applicant in its capacity as the exclusive owner of the intellectual property in Arche products applied for the registration of the trade mark 'Arche' in Pakistan on 11.05.1973 in respect of perfumery, lotions and other cosmetic goods falling in Class-3. The Registrar Trade Mark, Pakistan registered the following trade mark having registration No.58907 in the name of the applicant w.e.f. 11.05.1973:
 
5. The trade mark was renewed from time to time and lastly according to the contents of the application, w.e.f. 11.05.2009 for a period of ten years and continued to be registered in the name of the applicant till date. According to the applicant, vide application dated 26.3.2014 the applicant has further applied for the registration of trade marks for various other products in Class-3 and the process of registration of the trade marks is pending with the respondent No.2. During this time, the applicant became aware of the fact regarding registration of identical trade mark by Hamza for cosmetics products which is similar to the earlier trade mark of the applicant and resembles the said trade mark in material particular. The trade mark of Hamza was registered as trade mark No.247291 in Class-3 on 7.8.2014 w.e.f. 3.3.2008. The following is the pictorial depiction of the trade mark registered in the name of Hamza:
 with new evidence presented.","This application under section 80 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance, 2001) seeks the invalidation of the entry in Trade Marks Register regarding the Trade Mark No.247291 dated 03.03.2008 in Class-3 (""The Trade Mark""). The said trade mark belongs to respondent No.1 (trading as Hamza Cosmetics) (hereinafter, Hamza). In a nub, the case of the applicant is that the registration of the trade mark be declared invalid on the ground that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001. Primarily the declaration of invalidity has been sought or the ground of section 80(3)(a) and (b) which provide that:
""Grounds for invalidity of registration.-
(3) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground that there is-
(a) an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions set out in subsections (1), (2) or (3) of section 17 obtain: or
(b) an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out in subsection (4) of section 17 is satisfied, unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right has consented to the registration.
","During the course of the hearing the original record was produced by the office of the Registrar which shows the application of the trade mark made on 3.3.2008. A show cause notice was issued under section 27 of the Ordinance, 2001 to Hamza with specific reference to the trade mark registered in favour of the applicant priorly and on the basis of earlier conflicting trade mark. It cannot be gleaned from the record as to whether these proceedings culminated in an order passed by the Registrar or not. Be that as it may, the trade mark was registered ultimately and for whose invalidity the instant proceedings have been brought by the applicant.
19. In view of the above, this application is allowed. Trade mark registration No.247291 dated 3.3.2008 is declared invalid under the provisions of section 80(1) read with sections 14 and 14(4) of the Ordinance, 2001, and is struck off the Register of Trade Marks.
The original record which was retained with the Court Associate of this Court vide order dated 13.11.2018 is handed over to the representative of the Trade Mark Department present in the Court.
","Thus, according to the portion quoted in Jamia Industries Ltd., marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollect of the whole. Moreover, variations in details might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own. Also while determining whether a mark bears resemblance to another mark and is likely to deceive, the underlying rule is to determine by considering what is the leading characteristic of each of these marks.
13. The marks of both, the applicant as well as Hamza, have been reproduced above and there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the two marks resemble each other to such an extent that they are likely to deceive the mind of an unwary customer who will have to rely upon the leading characteristic of the mark of the applicant which characteristics are also comprised in and are part of the mark registered in the name of Hamza. Upon a visual comparison too the two marks are identical to each other and the mark registered in the name of Hamza has been registered for goods similar to those for which the earlier trade mark of the applicant was registered.
14. To reiterate the real question to decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon an average mind of ordinary intelligence would look to a particular trade mark and what impression he would form by looking at the trade mark. Applying the aforesaid principles to the instant case, not only visual appearance of the two marks are similar but they also relate to the same products and thus an average mind of ordinary intelligence would consider the goods of Hamza as that of the applicant. Thus, the registration in the name of Hamza is likely to deceive or confuse the customers. Also the applicant is the exclusive user of the mark not only in Pakistan but equally in other countries and has acquired the proprietorship of the mark and lays a rightful claim to the intellectual property of the said mark.

","Suit No.983 and C.M.A. No.6910 of 2007, decided on 2nd November, 2007.",,,"By this application the plaintiffs has prayed that defendant may be restrained from copying and/or applying the plaintiffs Registered designs namely 11357-D, 12310-D, 12311-D, 12312-D, 12328-D and 12329-D and plaintiff No.2's registered trademark No.187121 dated 19th July, 2003 namely ""BODYCAP"" and from making, importing, selling, hiring, offering to sell or hire or working articles bearing or embodying a design and/or trademark which, is a copy of the said registered designs.
 
The facts 'necessary for disposal of the application are that tilt plaintiff No.1 is the registered proprietor of above mentioned designs registered under Designs Ordinance XLV of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the registered designs) and the fibre canopies manufactured as per these designs are sold by the plaintiffs under the trademark "" BODYCAP"" duly registered in the name of plaintiff No.2. It. is alleged that the defendant is imitating the said designs and. applying the same to the canopies it manufactures, and sells.
 under different legal circumstances.","The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submit that the plaintiffs' are the registered proprietors of the designs and trademark and have the exclusive right to use the said designs and trademark and the defendant by using the said designs and trademark violating their exclusive, rights. He further submits that the canopies made by.. the defendant"" are similar to the canopies manufactured by the plaintiff and submits that for claiming infringement of registered designs it is not necessary that the imitation are substantially similar with the registered designs. The learned counsel has referred to the photographs of the registered designs as well as the photographs of the canopies manufactured by the defendant and submits that from looking two canopies it is established that they are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. ","For the above reason the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case in his favour and the balance of convenience is also in their favour and in case the injunction is not granted they will suffer irreparable loss and will be deprived from the benefits of the registered designs.
 
In view of the above the application is allowed as prayed with no order as to costs.

","The plaintiffs by filing the photocopies of the certificates for registration of designs and certificate of Registration of Trademark ""BODYCAP"" established their right to exclusively use the design and trademark. The plaintiff by filing the photographs of the canopies manufactured by it and by the defendant has also established that both are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. The defendant by not filing his reply has failed to rebut the above factual controversy.
 
Subsection (2) of section 7 of the Registered Design Ordinance provides that the owner of a registered design shall have right to exclude third parties, not having his consent, from making, selling or working articles or embodying a design which is a copy of the registered design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purpose.
 
The plaintiff No.1 being the Registered Proprietor of the designs mentioned above is entitled to exclusively use the same and defendant without his consent have no right to copy the same.
 
Section 8 of the Ordinance deals with infringement. Subsection (1) of section 8 provides that if any person infringes a registered proprietor's right, the registered proprietor may bring a suit against him for the recovery of damages and for an injunction against the continuation of the infringement. Provided that for the purpose of grant of a temporary injunction, the registered proprietor must show that he has a prima facie case and that his design is valid and that it has been infringed by the defendant.
 
The design of the defendant is almost similar to the registered designs of the plaintiffs and the Registered designs of plaintiff No. 1 are still valid.
 
In the unreported case of Messrs Team Nayyer (Pvt.) Limited v. Kamran Jamal Khan (Suit No.495 of 2007) authored by my learned brother Mushir Alam, J. it was held as under:
 
""After hearing the Federal counsel I have observed that there is apparently strong resemblance on both the canopies of the plaintiff and defendant and minor difference pointed out by the defendant, which are still subject to objection, cannot make much difference to remove the deception in respect to recognition as to whether both canopies are from one designer or not. The Registrar of design is also of the view that canopy of the plaintiff is registered with design No.12310-D while the design applied for by the defendant was refused.""
 
For claiming infringement it is not necessary that the two designs are similar to each other in all respect. Resemblance in two designs are sufficient to establish infringement. In this case the plaintiff prima facie established that the design of the defendant resembled with the registered designs of the plaintiff and is capable of creating confusion and deception.","

","Civil Appeal No.223-K of 2011, decided on 4th July, 2012.
(Against the judgment dated 29-12-2010 passed by High Court of Sindh, Karachi in M.A. No.55 of 2004).",,,"This Appeal impugns the Judgment of the learned High Court of Sindh (Karachi) in Miscellaneous Application No.55 of 2004 whereby the appeal filed by the respondent was allowed. Consequently the Order of the Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26-6-2004 dismissing the application of the respondent for registration of its trade mark i.e. ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" was set aside.
 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985. In 1991 an advertisement appeared in the Trade mark Journal for ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" for tea in respect of the respondent which was opposed by the appellant. The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
 with a different defendant.","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

","Suit No. 2223 of 2015 and Judicial Miscellaneous No. 9 of 2016, decided on 13th June, 2017.",,,"This single order will dispose of C.M.A. No.16652/2015 moved by the Plaintiff in Suit No.2223 of 2015, seeking injunction against the Defendant from using the getup and design of Design No.17023-D owned by the Plaintiff, as well as, restraining the Defendant from using trade mark ""ZORRO"" on the ground that the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of trade mark ""ORO"", as well J.M.No.09/2016 filed by the Defendant will also be disposed off, through which cancellation of the Plaintiff's registered design has been sought by the Defendant.
While it is admitted that the Plaintiff owns trade mark ""ORO"" which has been registered by it with the Trade Marks Registry in respect of class 16 goods w.e.f. 22.09.2010, it also has secured registration of the design of pencils (under dispute) as provided under the mechanism laid down by the Registered Designs Ordinance, 2000. An examination of the Design Registration Certificate dated 23.01.2014 shows that the novelty of the design has been claimed to reside in the ornamental pattern as applied to pencils, as fully illustrated in the representation of the design. 
Allegation levelled by the counsel for the Plaintiff are that the Defendant taking benefit of the attractive design of the Plaintiff commenced manufacturing of similarly designed pencils and to leave no stone unturned to reap benefit from the hard earned reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff, even applied thereon trade mark ""ZORRO"", which is allegedly deceptively similar with the Plaintiff's trade mark ""ORO"". with an additional plaintiff.","When attention is drawn to J.M. No.09/2016 in terms of which cancellation of Plaintiff's registered design is sought, the grounds alleged for such a cancellation are that the design registered by the Plaintiff is not new, easily available in the local and international market thus there is no element of novelty therein which is mandatory for obtaining registration of a design. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the Defendant produced a large number of pencils manufactured by third parties, which seemingly look alike the design registered by the Plaintiff. It was contended by the counsel that the said design was introduced in 1990 by M/s. Staedtler Mars GmbH & Co. a German company for its ""Noris"" range of pencils, which have been globally sold since then. In support of his contentions, he attached copies of Noris pencils.","The residual effect of the above is that while the Plaintiff has lost his design Registered No.17023-D on account of forceful attack made by the Defendant through J.M.No.09/2016, the Defendant is still restrained from using deceptively similar ""ZORRO"" trademarked pencils embodying the typical colours scheme (trade dress) adopted by the Plaintiff.

 
","As mentioned in the foregoing, to have a design registered under the Ordinance and to have a monopoly created thereon, it is essential that the design must have element of newness or originality under section 3(2) of the Ordinance and in the absence of the said newness or originality, no design could be registered. The condition of newness and originality, which under the previous 1911 Patent and Design Act was only limited to Pakistan, was extended globally under the 2000 Ordinance meaning thereby to have a design registered under the 2000 Ordinance, the design must be globally new or original.
The term ""design"" is defined by clause (e) of section 2 of the Ordinance to mean (in the given context) features of shape, configuration, pattern ornament applied to an article by any industrial process or means, being features which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye. Subsection (2) of section 3 requires that a design not to be registered unless it was new or original and, in particular, shall not be so registered in respect of any article if it is the same as a design which before the date of the application for registration has been registered in Pakistan or published anywhere in the world in respect of the same or any other article or differs from such a design only in immaterial details or in features which are variants commonly used in the trade. Explanation to the said section provides that designs would not be new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combination of design features. It is important to keep in mind that section 3 is couched in the negative terms, and requires that the design which is not new or original cannot be registered. The expression, ""new or original"" appearing in section 3 means that the design had been invented for the first time or it has not been reproduced by anyone before. As mentioned in the foregoing, since a design is to be judged solely by the eye, the said definition read with application for registration makes it clear that the shape or particular configuration has to have visual newness or originality. Such design, once it is registered cannot be copied by any other person, as long as the design is new or original and never ever reproduced by any other person. In the case at hand a large number of triangular shaped pencils, which were produced before this Court were allegedly available in the market and such shape of triangular shaped pencils being in common knowledge for decades, hence by no stretch of imagination such pencils which have been registered by the Plaintiff could be said to be new or original and invented by the Plaintiff. A simple search in Google for the phrase ""triangular shaped pencils"" shows about over 1.7 million hits. The fact is that these triangular shaped pencils have been in use since long for teaching toddlers how to write effectively as the circular pencils are hard to be held by small hands, being easy in grip, the said design has thus been popular and widely sold for decades. In Phillips v. Barbro Rubber Company (1920) 37 R.P.C. 233, Lord Moulton emphasized that it is the duty of the court to take special care that no design is to be counted as new and original design unless it distinguished from that previously existed by something essentially new or original which is different from ordinary trade variants. The very intent of section 10 of the Ordinance is to remove registrations of such designs from the Register which were registered in violation of substantive requirements prescribed by the Ordinance. In the case at hand it is abundantly clear that the design registered by the Plaintiff is devoid of newness or originality and it could also not be said that the Plaintiff had induced creative ingenuity in this very commonly available design to the extent that the resulting design could withhold the threshold of newness or originality and stay registered as such. Accordingly, the J.M.No.09/2016 is allowed on the ground of lack of newness and originality in the Plaintiff's designed pencils.
Notwithstanding the above conclusion, a comparison of the rival pencils as shown above reveals that the Defendant has not only used identical colour scheme and getup (trade dress) of pencils used by the Plaintiff, as well as, its trade mark ""ZORRO"" embodies Plaintiff's complete trade mark ""ORO"" in full, therefore, when Moron in a Hurry test as developed by Mr. Justice Foster in the 1978 Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited [1979 FSR 113] is applied, there is no doubt that an unwary purchaser will not be deceived on account of the startling resemblances between the rival pencils. Accordingly the application filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. by the Plaintiff succeeds.

","M.A. No. 11 of 2006, decided on 11th November, 2019.","27th May, 2019.","SYED HASAN AZHAR RIZVI, J.","The brief facts of this case are that the appellant is a private limited company incorporated in Pakistan. The dispute involves ownership rights of trademark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan in respect to Class 16 of the international classification of goods. The parent organization of the appellant, Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO), introduced public survey and public opinions research in Pakistan. PIPO and its affiliate organization Gallup Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited and the appellant are the only members of Gallup International Association in Pakistan and are the exclusive users of trade mark GALLUP in Pakistan till to date. In 1981, PIPO became the exclusive Associate Member of Gallup International in Pakistan. In 1984, PIPO became the exclusive full member of Gallup International in Pakistan and PIPO and its affiliates have been consistently using the trademark GALLUP and Gallup Pakistan together with Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion since at least 1981. Gallup Pakistan has been existing for nearly forty years and has been the exclusive user of the trade mark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan. The joint names of Gallup Pakistan and Gallup Organization in the International Gallup Directories illustrate that respondent No. 2 never claimed any right for use of name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan nor objected to the use of the said name by the appellant and its affiliates in Pakistan. Respondent No. 2 accepted throughout the right of Gallup Pakistan to use the name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan exclusively. The appellant on 07.5.1994 filed an Application No. 124363 for registration of its trademark ""GALLUP"" in Class 16 and the application was accepted for advertisement. Respondent No. 2 filed Opposition No. 56 of 1999 alleging that it was the proprietor of Trade Mark ""GALLUP"" and also disclosed pendency of its Application No. 129970 dated 02.5.1995 for registration of same mark in same class. Respondent No. 2 has failed to file a single document showing use of the name ""Gallup"" by them in Pakistan. The appellant filed a counter statement to the opposition along with documentary evidence and affidavit supporting such counter statement. Respondent No. 2 never filed any reply or rejoinder to the counter-statement of the appellant. The contents of the appellant's counter statement therefore remain un-rebutted till date. under unusual conditions.","""Who is the proprietor of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan?""
""Whether use of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan by the Appellant would entitle it to secure registration in its name?""
""Whether the adoption of the trademark 'Gallup' by Applicant constitutes honest concurrent user?""","After taking into account evidence about the long history of the GIA, domestic courts in these and many other countries came to recognize that Respondent No. 2 is just a rich American corporation which is trying to unfairly bag the fruits of the labor of independent scholars from all over the world.""
""Therefore, the plea of the appellant that since presently the respondent No.1 is not dealing in 'tea-product' hence registration of its mark 'AHMAD LOAD TEA' shall cause no harm to respondent No.1 is misconceived.""
""As regard another plea of the appellant that since respondent No.1 has not objected/opposed to grant of mark 'AHMED' in class-30 to other entity 'AHMED TEA COMPANY, PESHAWAR' hence respondent No.1 cannot object / oppose the application of the appellant, it would suffice to say that such plea alone cannot prevail over the rights, created by section 29(4) of the Ordinance to every such application nor legally mere negligence in making proper opposition to some earlier application can be a ground to deprive the authorized user from those rights and privileges which are the creation of the law itself.""","Mr. Ijaz Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the impugned order has been passed without taking into consideration the fact that the appellant is the exclusive user of trademark ""Gallup"" in Pakistan, which is established by admitted documents. He has further argued that it is an established fact that the name of the appellant or its parent organization has appeared several times in Gallup International Directories along with and to the knowledge of respondent No.2. He has also argued that respondent No.2's use of this trademark anywhere else in the world is irrelevant as respondent No.2 has failed to prove any work carried out by them in Pakistan. He has urged that the entire project of Gallup Pakistan was started by Dr. Ijaz Shafi Gilani upon encouragement of Dr. Gallup since 1978. He has also urged that Dr. Gallup and scholars from their respective countries established ""The International Association of Public Opinions Institutes"" which was later converted into ""Gallup International Research Institutes and thereafter Gallup International Association was incorporated, which took over the business of Gallup International Research Institutes and Gallup International only makes one member in every country, these members also had the right to use the name ""Gallup"" in Dr. Gallup's own life time as well as afterwards. He has argued that the Appellant is honest, concurrent user in terms of international usage and reputation of the trademark ""Gallup"".
Learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the impugned order is a non-speaking order and does not contain any reasoning at all for arriving at the conclusion. It merely reproduces the contention of the parties and nothing more as the only discussion made by the Registrar does not contain any reasoning and completely ignores the evidence produced by the appellant. He has urged that Registrar has failed to mention a single document filed by the appellant. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed by completely ignoring the relevant facts and evidence. In this regard he made reference to Section 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 clearly states that disputed issues relating to title of a trademark cannot be decided without proper evidence.",MH/G-45/Sindh Appeal allowed.,Allowed

 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985.

The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
 with an additional plaintiff.","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

FECTO CEMENT LIMITED through Chief Executive Officer and 3 others---Respondents
 

 
","First Appeal from Order No.213 of 2012, decided on 28th September, 2012.",,,"Appellant herein is a public limited company and claims to be the creator, originator, owner and user of trademark ""P"" in stylized form (hereafter stylized ""P"" logo) which it claims to be using since the inception of its business of cement manufacturing, marketing and selling for more than two decades. It claims to have launched a new brand of cement for export to Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics with the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device. It is claimed that cement bags with the said trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device were designed and printed for the appellant first time by a company called Syntronics Limited in May 2010.
The appellant claims to have engaged respondent No.3, a Pakistani company having its office in Peshawar as its distributor and submits that respondent No.3, as a distributor of the appellant, entered into a contract with an Afghan company named Shirkat-ul-Faisal and started exporting cement to Afghanistan under the trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device. It is alleged that after some time relationship between the appellant and respondent No.3 came to an end, whereafter respondent No.3 contracted appellant's competitor, respondent No.1, and started exporting cement to Shirakat-ul-Faisal in Afghanistan under appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device in utter disregard of law and violation of business ethics and with dishonesty and mala fide.
To restrain respondents from using the aforesaid trademark, the appellant filed a suit for infringement coupled with passing off the goods before the learned District Judge, Lahore, along with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. and the learned Additional District Judge granted a restraining order on 24th June, 2011 which was withdrawn through the impugned order dated 29-3-2012. 
The respondents resisted the suit and inter alia challenged the claim of proprietorship of the trademark by the appellant. Certain allegations about concealment of some facts concerning dealership were also raised and it was also asserted that Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited has obtained registration of Two Elephants device in Afghanistan. Strong reliance by the respondents was placed on obtaining trademark registration in Afghanistan by Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited in Afghanistan. under unusual conditions.","Whether the appellant is the prior user and owner of the disputed trademark comprising the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device and whether the respondents' use of the trademark constitutes infringement and passing off.","In the light of the above, this appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned order dated 29-3-2012, is set aside. The respondents are restrained to use the appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device till the final disposal of the suit. It is however noted that the observations made above are tentative in nature and would not influence the decision of the suit on merits after recording of evidence. As valuable rights of parties are involved it is ordered that the trial Court shall decide the suit within six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.","If Do Pheel/Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, a Director of respondent No.3, it seems inconceivable that they would continue to use it with stylized ""P"" logo, as stylized ""P"" logo is admittedly the trademark of appellant. This, prima facie, shows dishonesty on the part of the respondents. In this respect even if, for argument's sake, it is considered that Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, then if, as per respondent's own stance that their dealership was unlawfully cancelled by the appellant, it was their legal, moral and ethical duty to have only taken their alleged Two Elephants device trademark to respondents Nos.1 and 2 (Fecto Cement Limited) to start export with Two Elephants device replacing appellant's stylized ""P"" logo with that of Fecto's own logo. This was apparently not done for obvious reasons that respondents desired to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" logo as a trademark of the appellant by virtue of its use on cement exported to Afghanistan.
There is a further aspect to respondents' prima facie dishonest act and their efforts to deceive the Courts. If Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4 (Mr. S. Mehtab Hussain), a Director of respondent No.3, then it is not understandable why they would allow Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited, which is a separate entity, to register it in its name in Afghanistan and not in the name of the said respondent or respondent No.3. 
As far as Distributorship is concerned it is pertinent to note that respondents in their written statement have admitted the existence of distributorship and have referred to it as well as attached a copy of said letter in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Factual Matrix of the written statement as reproduced below:--

(1) That the plaintiff approached defendant(s) Nos.3 and 4 in order to subscribe to their services as exclusive and sole distributor(s)/dealer(s). The plaintiff, at all material times, represented and assured that defendant No.3 would be engaged to the exclusion of all others. It is submitted that Dho Pheel/(the two elephants) was the brainchild of defendant No.4, who is and was at all material times, the Director of defendant No.3.

(2) That the plaintiff through its General Manager (Marketing and Sales), Mr. Rizwari Butt, confirmed the appointment of defendant No.4 as the authorized Sole Distributor for Afghanistan and CARs (Central Asian Republics) through a letter dated 29-3-2010. A copy of the letter dated 29-3-2010 is placed herewith as Annex-E.

(3) That the albeit it is beyond the scope of the present proceedings, it is nevertheless the case that the plaintiff flagrantly breached the Dealership Agreement, which it had struck with defendant No.3. Consequently, the latter, on the plaintiff's contractual repudiation, was but only impelled to enter into a Dealership Agreement dated 20-4-2011 with defendant No.1 (viz, Fecto Cement Limited). A copy of an email written by defendant No.4 to the General Manager of defendant No.1 substantiating these state of affairs is placed herewith as Annex -F.
The learned trial Court has stated the correct principle that in trademark cases most important factor is who is prior user of trademark. This principle is in particular applicable when none of the contesting parties is armed with a registered trademark. Despite stating the correct principle, in my humble view, the learned trial Judge committed a serious error when he concluded that the plaintiff company (appellant) did not produce any cogent and convincing material in this regard. This apparently reflects that the learned trial Judge did not pay much attention to the pleadings of the parties nor perused the documents available on the record. 
In the present case, there is admittance on the part of the respondents that respondent No.3 has acted as a distributor for the appellant and sold appellant's cement with the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device to Afghanistan. Therefore, there is no denial or challenge that the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device was not first used by the appellant and cement with this trademark was not sold in Afghanistan through respondent No.3 as a distributor of appellant and thus there is no denial that appellant is the prior user of the disputed trademark.
In my humble opinion the distributor's appointment letter and above admitted facts were sufficient to, prima facie, show that appellant was the prior user and prior owner of the Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" trademark for cement. Moreover the respondents have not explained the reason for their choice to use the stylized ""P"" logo along with Two Elephants, when respondent No.1 itself seems to be a well known company, it should have chosen to use its own independent logo and not that of its competitors. It is in particular not appreciable that big business groups resort to copying their competitors trademarks, as, prima facie, seems to be the case here.
In the light of the above, it clearly appears that the appellant has made out a prima facie case in its favour and is likely to suffer irreparable loss if the respondents are not restrained from using the stylized ""P"" logo and the Two Elephants device. I must add here that trademark rights are lifelines of businesses and unauthorized use of owner's trademark by third parties results in un-quantifiable loss and damage to its goodwill and business which is irreparable in nature. Thus the loss that the appellant is likely to suffer as a result of use of appellant's trademark by the respondents cannot be calculated in terms of monetary compensation and would be irreparable in nature. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the appellant. I must also observe that under section 46(2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 all such reliefs by way of damages, injunction, accounts are available to the proprietor of a trademark simultaneously and not as an alternate to each other and just because in addition to interim injunction a plaintiff may claim damages and compensation in a suit relating to trademark rights, interim relief cannot be denied on that ground.

Messrs TARA CROP SCIENCES (PRIVATE) LIMITED FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES: In the matter of
 

 
","Show Cause Notice No. 11/2014 dated 22nd May, 2014, decided on 19th June, 2015.",,,"The Complainant is a fertilizer and chemical manufacturing concern, engaged in the production of urea, phosphate and allied products. The Respondent is one of a group of undertakings under the umbrella of M/s. Tara Group. It is engaged in the manufacturing and selling of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and is the undertaking behind the one-stop franchise network of 'Tara Zarai Markaz'. Both are undertakings in terms of section 2(1)(q) of the Act.
The Complainant alleged that its brand 'Tara' was being used fraudulently and illegally by the Respondent to market its products and business. It further alleged that the Respondent had resorted to the dissemination of misleading information which was capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant. The Complainant consequently submitted that they found the provisions of section 10 of the Act to be attracted by the conduct of the Respondent, hence their complaint.
 
With regard to the above, a formal enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 04 April 2014, ('Enquiry Report'). Based on the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report, a SCN was issued to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before the Commission on 10 June 2014. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
10. WHEREAS, in terms of Paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, it appears that the use of trademarks of the Complainant by the Undertaking, without seeking permission and any authorization, through its advertisements and marketing campaigns disseminated the information that misleads the consumers regarding the origin of products being sold at the TARA ZARAI MARAKAZ owned and controlled by the Undertaking, and also gives an impression that the exclusive franchise network of TARA ZARAI MARKAZ are affiliates/franchise/branch of the Complainant, which appears to be false/misleading information that is lacking a reasonable basis, related to method or place of production, suitability for use or quality of goods/services in violation of subsection (1) of section 10, in particular, clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
11. WHEREAS, in terms of paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, the Undertaking was using the trademark of the Complainant fraudulently and without Complainant's authorization on the facades, nearby boards and hoardings of its exclusive franchise network one-stop shops i.e. TARA ZARAI MARKAZ for advertisement/marketing purposes, which constitutes 'deceptive marketing practices' in terms of subsection (1) of Section 10, in particular, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
12. WHEREAS, in terms of the paragraphs 49 to 74 of the Enquiry Report, the unauthorized use of Complainant's trademark by the Undertaking on the facades, nearby boards and hoardings of their exclusive franchise network one-stop shops i.e. TARA ZARAI MARKAZ for advertisement/marketing purposes, prima facie, is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of subsection (1) of section 10, in particular, clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act;
 under unusual conditions.","The issues identified are therefore as follows:
 
(a) Whether the Commission can take cognizance of the complaint during the pendency of Civil Suit No 525/2012;
 
(b) Whether the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' in its franchise network named 'Tara Zarai Markaz' in the presence of the Complainant's products in the market which include the same term, amounts to a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(a), (b) and/or (d) of the Act.
","In view of the Respondent's violation of section 10 of the Act, the Commission hereby imposes on it a penalty of:
 
(i) Pakistani Rupees Five Hundred Thousand (PKR 500,000) for contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
 
(ii) Pakistani Rupees Five Hundred Thousand (PKR 500.000) for contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(b) of the Act;
The Respondent is therefore liable to pay a sum of Pakistani Rupees One Million (PKR 1,000,000).

The Commission further directs the Respondent to immediately cease solitary use of the distinct term 'Tara', as in its present form, in its exclusive franchise network `Tara Zarai Markaz'. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the franchise network is renamed so as to make it perfectly clear that its business has no connection with the Complainant's brand or products.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order, and is reprimanded from indulging in deceptive marketing practices in the future at the risk of severe penal consequences.
In terms of the above, SCN No.11/2014 is hereby disposed of.
","With respect to the maintainability of concurrent proceedings before the Commission, and its jurisdiction in light of the pendency of Civil Suit No. 525/2012, the Respondent raised the contention that the subject matter and prayers of both the cases were the same, and therefore fell under the ambit of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, (the 'C.P.C.'). While this issue has previously been addressed in the Enquiry Report, since it was raised again at the hearing stage, we find it necessary to provide a brief explanation anew.
We find this argument to be without merit. Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of 'res sub judice'. The purpose behind the provision, as explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits' pending in 'courts'.
Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The relevant portion is reproduced below for convenience:
Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act XLV of 1860), and the Commission shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi-judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'court' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court. Furthermore, the settled interpretation of section 10 of the C.P.C. provides that for the section to be applicable, the two suits must be pending before courts of competent jurisdiction. In Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Messrs Azeem Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. for example, it was held by the Sindh High Court that where proceedings are not in the nature of a civil suit and are instead special proceedings provided for under special law, the provisions of section 10 of the C.P.C. would not be attracted.
With respect to the second issue, we will begin by demarcating the boundaries of the matter under discussion. Both parties have made extensive submissions with regard to their trademarks, both registered and unregistered, and alleged infringements thereof. At the very outset therefore, we find it pertinent to clarify that the mandate of the Commission encompasses the protection and promotion of competition. While this includes the protection of competition against fraudulent use of trademarks, which serve to indicate proprietary interests of undertakings, it does not extend to the allocation thereof. The granting of the proprietary rights in intellectual property remains the sole domain of the Intellectual Property Organization (the 'IPO'), and the Commission cannot make any determination in this regard. Neither should the discussion in the order be construed to give credence to either party's trademark claim.

In view of all of the above therefore, we find that the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' constitutes dissemination of misleading information which is doubtlessly capable of harming the Complainant's business interests, which is a violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act. We also finds that the Respondent's use of the term 'Tara' in the name of its exclusive franchise network constitutes a deceptive marketing in terms of section 10(2)(b) and thus amount to a violation of section 10(1) of the Act.

"," 
Suit No. 727 of 2008, decided on 27th May, 2013.",,,"The plaintiffs have filed this suit against defendant No.1 for accounts, recovery of money, damages, and perpetual and mandatory injunctions. Before dealing with the case of the plaintiffs, it is necessary to trace their background and to understand the circumstances in which they were constrained to file the present Suit.
 Plaintiff No.1 BAYER AG, which is an international chemical and pharmaceutical company incorporated and based in the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling a variety of products, as well as providing services in diverse areas such as health care, agrochemical products, organic products, specialty chemicals, industrial products, engineering materials, etc. The business and operations of plaintiff No.1 are spread almost all over the world. Plaintiff No.1 is the owner of the name 'BAYER' since 1-8-1863, when the founder of plaintiff No.1 Mr. Fredrich Bayer started his business in the name and style 'Friedr'. Bayer et comp' in partnership with one Mr. Fredrich Weskott. The partnership was converted into a joint stock company in the year 1981 in the name and style 'Farbenfabriken vorm Friedr Bayer & Co.' Plaintiff No.1 entered into the pharmaceutical business in the year 1888, for which it is well known and acknowledged throughout the world, including Pakistan. In the year 1904, plaintiff No.1 developed, adopted and started using its corporate image, the Bayer Cross Logo, wherein the word 'BAYER' appears vertically as well as horizontally within a circle, and the words intersect at the letter 'Y'. The name of plaintiff No.1 was changed in the year 1972 to its present name, that is, 'BAYER AG'. Plaintiff No.2 'Bayer HealthCare AG' is a wholly owned subsidiary of plaintiff No.1.
 In addition to their company name 'Bayer', the principal trademark 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, the plaintiffs also coined/developed/created various 'Bay' Formative Marks, that are being used by them in their pharmaceutical products all over the world. It has been claimed by the plaintiffs that the word 'Bayer' is in their exclusive use since 1863 as their trade name, company name, trademark, service mark and house mark, which as well as the Bayer Cross Logo, appear on all their products, product packaging, buildings, structures, stationery and vehicles. The plaintiffs have also claimed that they have been using 'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' as their trademarks/company names/trade names, and the Bayer Cross Logo as their logo, and in all their printed and audio-visual promotions and advertisements in Pakistan during the past several years, they have prominently and extensively used their trademarks/company names/trade names/'Bayer' and 'BAYER HEALTHCARE'. The plaintiffs have further claimed that the word 'Bayer' has never been used by or associated with anyone else throughout the world. Because of the use of the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks exclusively by the plaintiffs, and their extensive promotions and advertisements by them, the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks have acquired not only substantial reputation and goodwill in Pakistan, but have also created strong awareness in the general public that all the above are associated only with the plaintiffs, and all products with the word 'Bayer', the Bayer Cross Logo and the 'Bay' Formative Marks thereon, belong exclusively to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have averred that they have been carrying on their pharmaceutical business in Pakistan for several decades in the name and style Bayer Pakistan (Private) Limited, a Pakistani subsidiary/sister concern of plaintiff No.1, which uses several trademarks of plaintiff No.1 in Pakistan, including the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, under the authority and supervision of plaintiff No.1. In order to protect their interests in their trademark 'Bayer' and 'Bay' Formative Marks, the plaintiffs have obtained their registration in Pakistan. The sale figures of the plaintiffs' products in Pakistan run into hundreds of millions of Rupees every year.
It is the case of the plaintiffs that all their products manufactured, sold and marketed in Pakistan depict the company name 'Bayer' and the Bayer Cross Logo, and in addition to the above, various pharmaceutical products bearing the marks derived from the prefix 'Bay', that is, 'Bay' Formative Marks, such as 'LIPOBAY' and 'GLUCOBAY', are being sold in Pakistan since 1991, when the said products were got registered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are also using the trademark 'BAYCUTEN' with the prefix 'Bay' in Pakistan since 1991, and the said product is still being sold. Another trademark 'BAYDAL' with the prefix 'Bay' has been recently introduced in Pakistan by the plaintiffs, and they intend to introduce in future more products in Pakistan with 'Bay' Formative Marks.
The plaintiffs have stated that in November 2007, they came to know through an advertisement in the Trade Marks Journal No.681 dated 1-10-2007, published on 31-10-2007, that defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' had filed applications with the Registrar of Copyrights for registration of trademarks 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS', as copyright. It has been alleged that, defendant No.1 had adopted and started using the aforementioned imitated 'Bay' Formative Marks in an unauthorized and mala fide manner. Through the said applications filed by defendant No.1, the plaintiffs also came to know that defendant No.1 had been incorporated as a company in the above name and style. It has been strongly alleged by the plaintiffs that, by using the prefix 'Bay' in its name and the purported trademarks, defendant No.1 has attempted to take undue advantage of the plaintiffs' well known and reputed trademark, service mark, company name and trade name, that is, 'Bayer', Bayer Cross Logo and 'Bay' Formative Marks.
 with new evidence presented.","After carefully examining two authorities and the other reported cases, I feel that there is hardly anything that can be added to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court or the findings given by other Superior Courts for determining the criteria as to whether or not a case falls under the definition of infringement or passing off. As I have understood, in a case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has infringed his trademark, copyright or trade name, it is to be gauged as to whether or not the products of the plaintiff and the defendant are identical, or to what extent they are similar. The products, without any investigation or close examination, should look identical or similar in size, shape, colour/colour scheme, texture, packing, presentation, or appearance, so as to deceive the customer/consumer to purchase/use the product of the defendant without any hesitation or doubt in his mind, under the impression that he has purchased/used the product of the plaintiff. It is not necessary that the defendant's product should have all the above characteristics to look similar or identical to the product of the plaintiff; any one, or some of them, may be sufficient in some cases to create such a situation. If the customer/consumer gets deceived or becomes doubtful or confused after looking at or comparing the products of the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff will be justified in bringing an action against the defendant. In my opinion, it is not necessary that the deception or confusion was caused by the defendant deliberately or intentionally, and even unintentional deception and confusion in such cases would give rise to a cause of action to the plaintiff, as the main element is the deception and/or confusion, and not the intention of the person responsible for the deception and/or confusion. The above aspect becomes more important and applicable when the plaintiff and the defendant are operating and carrying on business in the same area/field, the nature of their business is the same or similar, and the operations and business of the plaintiff were prior in time to those of the defendant. I am also of the view that when a person, firm or company decides to start the business in a particular name and style or with a particular trademark or copyright, he/they are duty-bound to ascertain and ensure that the name and style or the trademark or copyright which they intend to use, was not being used by any other entity. If such caution is not exercised and any infringement and/or passing off is caused, the entire responsibility as to the consequences shall rest on the person/entity who uses the same or similar name and style, trademark or copyright that was already in the use of or was already owned by the other entity.","In view of the above discussion and findings, and also as the plaintiffs have successfully proven their case, the Suit is decreed with costs against defendant No.1 to the extent of Prayers (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vii) made in paragraph 26 of the plaint, and Prayers (a) and (b) made in paragraph 26.1 of the plaint, as prayed by the plaintiffs. It is hereby ordered that defendant No.1 shall immediately take all necessary steps for changing/rectifying its name in the record of defendant No.2 by ensuring that the company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, belonging to and owned by the plaintiffs, are deleted/removed from the name of defendant No.1 with immediate effect. The entire exercise shall be completed by defendant No.1 within thirty (30) days hereof. Defendant No.2, the Deputy Registrar of Companies, SECP, Karachi, is hereby directed that in case defendant No.1 does not initiate the above process or the said process is not completed within the stipulated time frame, defendant No.2 shall ensure that the registration of defendant No.1 in its present imitated name is cancelled, and the rectification in the defendant No.1's name is carried out in the above terms in letter and spirit. Defendant No.2 is further directed to submit the compliance report to this Court through the M.I.T. within one week after the expiration of the stipulated period.
The office is directed to forward copies of this judgment to the M.I.T., as well as to defendant No.2 and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad, for compliance.","In the present case, the plaintiffs have successfully established that they are the lawful owners of their company name/trade name/service mark/trademark 'Bayer', the trademark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE', the prefix 'Bay', the 'Bay' Formative Marks, and the 'Bayer' Logo. The comparison and a bare perusal of the defendant No.1's name as well as the names of its products show that the prefix 'Bay' and the 'Bay' Formative Marks owned by the plaintiffs, have been used therein by defendant No.1 in a glaring and obvious manner. The name of defendant No.1 'Bayhealth Care (Private) Limited' encompasses not only the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs, but also the words 'health Care', which are the part and parcel of the trade mark 'BAYER HEALTHCARE' owned by the plaintiffs. Likewise, the prefix 'Bay' owned by the plaintiffs distinctly, prominently and unambiguously appears in the products 'BAYOXY', 'BAYFASTIN', and 'BAYTORVIS' manufactured, sold and marketed by defendant No.1. The above similarities are of such nature that they can go unnoticed, undetected and unchecked very easily, and the same are bound to cause deception or confusion in the minds of the customers/consumers, doctors, retailers, dealers, stockists, etc., that the imitated products of defendant No.1 are those of the plaintiffs, especially when all the imitated products of defendant No.1 with its imitated name thereon, and those of the plaintiffs, are sold, marketed, used and consumed as pharmaceutical products. The similarities between the trademarks and the company/trade names of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1, are so obvious and unambiguous that because of the use of the plaintiff's prefix 'Bay' and the word 'healthCare' of the plaintiffs' trademark by defendant No.1, its products and the plaintiffs' products look identical. As such, no inquiry. or investigation is required to compare or distinguish the products. My above observations clearly show that this is a case of infringement of the plaintiff's trademarks and company/trade names by defendant No.1, and that of passing off its goods, business and services as those of the plaintiffs, especially in view of Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold that if the two marks are absolutely identical, no further probe is needed and infringement is established.
Regarding the prayer made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and the prayer for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present name of defendant No.1, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh and Sons Ltd. and another v. Azhar Wali Muhammad and 11 others, 1986 MLD 1870. In view of the cases of Messrs Muhammad Bakhsh & Sons Ltd. and Messrs ADT Services AG (supra), it is clear that the prayers made by the plaintiffs for the grant of permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from maintaining the registration of its imitated name with the office of defendant No.2, and for the grant of mandatory injunction for issuing a direction to defendant No.2 to rectify the present imitated name of defendant No.1, can be granted by this Court.
Subsection (2) of section 37 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, provides as under:--

""(2) A company shall not be registered by a name identical with that by which a company in existence is already registered, or so nearly resembling that name as to be calculated to deceive, except where the company in existence is in the course of being dissolved and signifies its consent in such manner as the registrar requires.""

In view of this mandatory provision in the Companies Ordinance, 1984, the name of defendant No.1 ought not have been entertained or registered by the Deputy Registrar concerned, as the company/trade name of defendant No.1 contains the plaintiffs' company/trade name, the trademark as well as the prefix 'Bay' Formative Marks. For the same reason, the Registrar Trademarks ought not have entertained or registered the products of defendant No.1. Both the above named authorities failed in discharging their statutory functions and duties in accordance with law. If these authorities perform their functions and duties vigilantly and in a prudent manner, the possibility of infringement and passing off can be curbed to a great extent, and unnecessary inconvenience and loss to parties as well as uncalled for litigation could be avoided.

a) That opposition No.292/2004 may be disallowed.
b) That applicant's application No.149770 in class 30 be allowed to proceed to registration
c) That cost of these proceedings may be awarded.
3. Respondent No.1 (Messrs Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.) Limited) a company incorporated in Pakistan under the Companies Ordinance 1984, Manufacturers, Merchants, Importers and Exporters, opposed the registration of Trade Mark ""AHMED TEA"" advertised under application No.149770 Class-30 in the Trade Marks Journal No.632, on the grounds that they have for many years carried on a reputable business in Pakistan and outside the country as manufacturers, merchants, importer and exporters of wide range of products falling in Class-29, 30 and 32; that they are well known all over the country and in every part of the world due to huge exports of food items and other allied goods; having overseas offices, manufacturing companies in a number of countries and have local agents and distributors; that the trademark use by them in respect of its aforesaid business is AHMED which besides being its principal world famous trademark is also its house mark; that word Ahmed also forms a part of their corporate name Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd; that trademark AHMED was first adopted and used by them in the year 1952 and is continuously in use since then and is presently used on a large number of foods items; that in view of the good quality of products and intensive publicity campaigns, the trademark AHMED has exclusively become associated with them throughout the world including Pakistan and in order to protect their rights and interest in that trademark they have applied for registration in almost all the territories of the world. However, the appellants had applied for legistration of trademark AHMED TEA with prior knowledge of the popularity and reputation of the trademark AHMED of respondent No.1 and with a view to trade upon the goodwill and reputation of respondent No.1 in the above trademark; that respondent No.1 are of the definite opinion that the use of the impugned trademark AHMED TEA by appellants would lead to the two marks being confused with each other and would create confusion and deception amongst the consumers and would give monetary and goodwill loss to the respondent No.1; that the application filed by appellants before respondent No.2 was clearly an attempt to trade unfairly upon the reputation and goodwill of respondent No.1 and to deceive the public into believing that the goods bearing trademark AHMED TEA emanates from respondent No.1 or from person having, business association with respondent No.1 and that likelihood of deception and confusion as to trade origin or trade connection is more serious because the goods are of the same description and are used and purchased by same class of purchasers through same trade channel; that appellants aforesaid trademark AHMED TEA is objectionable under sections 10(1) and 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, by reason of its being likely to deceive or to cause confusion; also appellants mark if used would be disentitled to protection in a court of justice under section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. with new evidence presented.","""whether a registration under the law alone is sufficient to take a control over such trade?""
""whether the applicant's application No.149770 in class-30 should be refused registration?""","Prima facie, the order impugned was/is in line with all settled principles and is not open to any exception. Accordingly, same is maintained. Appeal is dismissed.","The purpose of registration is nothing but to ensure a protection to the goodwill, name and reputation of a 'trade-mark' so as to avoid any mala fide move of other competitor to come and take the benefit of such name and reputation of the `mark' which, undoubtedly, is not established in a day nor can it be achieved over-night.
The registration of person in the register of proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation of those goods and that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person, who not being the proprietor of the trade mark of a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembles it as to likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered.

The respondent No.1 is authorized user of the mark 'AHMED'; the respondent No.1. has been using the mark 'AHMED' since 1952; the respondent No.1's mark 'AHMED' is registered in both classes i.e '29 and 30' of fourth schedule; dealing with goods of such classes both nationally and internationally.
The appellant has applied for registration of 'AHMED' as it 'mark'; the registration of such 'mark' is for class '30'; A bare look at mark of appellant cannot be said to be dissimilar to that of trade mark of the respondent No.1 i.e 'AHMED' for reading and even is phonetically identical.
since the 'tea' will be sold from one and same counter wherefrom goods of the respondent No.1 shall be sold because it has no where, been claimed by the appellant that respondent No.1 sells its goods at its own 'outlet'. Further, it is also not the case of the appellant that the goods of appellant i.e 'tea' shall be offered/sold to some other class of public therefore, prima facie, the Registrar was quite right in refusing the registration of the mark of the appellant in 'class-30'.

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the interim injunctive relief sought.","I have noticed that the similarity between the two marks is so striking and the intention to infringe is so obvious that the argument of balance of convenience is of no avail to the defendant. I am also of the view that since prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff; it does not open to the defendants to say that they ought to be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong. Moreover, the pendency of the application of defendant No.2 for registration of his mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks will not disentitle the plaintiff being proprietor of a registered trade mark from his exclusive right to its use and that such right will be deemed to be infringed by any person who uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling to as it likely to deceive or cause confusion in view of sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance. I have gone through the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the defendants and I am of the view that the same on being distinguishable facts and law do not advance the case of the defendants. I, therefore, allow C.M.A. No. 5628 of 2020, as prayed. Consequently, C.M.A. No. 9830 of 2020 stands dismissed on being infructuous.","It appears from the pleadings of the parties that the plaintiff claims to have launched Baroque's first showroom in Karachi in the year 2007 and secured the said brand and the interests associated with it by registering it with the name of ""'Baroque"" with the Trademark Registry at Karachi in the relevant Classes 20, 24 to 27, 35, 37 and 42 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, in February, 2016 and also got it registered as a copyright since January, 2017 under the category of ""Artistic Work"" (label design) with the Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan, Copyright office, Karachi bearing registration No. 35172-Copr. It is also claim of the plaintiff that even prior to the registration of the ""Baroque Inc."" trademark and copyright, the plaintiff's rights in the use of mark ""Baroque"" were protected under the law of passing off in view of the use of the mark by her since the year 2001. Trademark Registration Certificates are annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""E/1"" to ""E/1"" at page 133 to 147 and Certificate of Registration of Copyright in the artistic work (label design) Baroque is annexed as annexure ""F"" at page 149.

it may be observed that the plaintiff's trademark is admittedly registered under Classes 25 and 26 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, which are related to wearing apparel, clothing etc. and fabric and furniture trimmings and the defendant No.2 is admittedly offering his goods/ wearing apparel and clothing, which being falling under the Class 25 are identical with the name of BAROQUE and the consumer served are of the same category, as such, the features of defendants' goods do make out a case of there being likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their source",KMZ/M-13/Sindh Application allowed.,Allowed

","Crl. Org. No. 28 of 2016, decided on 19th February, 2016.",,,"Through this criminal original, the petitioner has prayed for initiating contempt proceedings against the respondent for allegedly disobeying the order of this Court dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondent had given an undertaking before this Court which is recorded in its order dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015 that he will confine his business under his trademark (Mark-A) which is registered in respect of goods and not in relation to providing services. He further submits that as the trademark of the respondent is only registered for goods, he cannot use it ostensibly for restaurant services etc. with new evidence presented.","When quarried as to whether there is any prohibition under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, or any Act or law which is applicable in Pakistan to prevent use of an unregistered trademark or a service mark, learned counsel cannot point out any such provision or law. The Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 lays down provisions for registration of 'trademark' as well as 'service mark'. If an original owner of a trademark fails to register its trademark in relation to its services, he cannot be taken to task for that failure. The respondent is not infringing the trademark of the petitioner or the rights of any other person rather in the previous round of litigation in F.A.O. No.29/2015 it was the respondent who claimed infringement of his trademark by the petitioner. In that appeal, the petitioner was found at fault as such, he was directed to make changes in his trademark in order to prevent confusion and deception amongst the consumers/general public.","This criminal original is, therefore, dismissed with a cost of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand only) to be deposited by the petitioner in the Dispensary of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, within one month from the date of this order, receipt whereof will be deposited with Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court for placing on this file, otherwise it would be collected as arrears of land. Office will place this file in the Chamber on May 23, 2016 as a ""compliance case"".
","Be that as it may, I find that no undertaking was given by the respondent before this Court on 01.06.2015 in F.A.O. No.29/2015 for not using its registered trademark in relation to services. The bona fide use of an unregistered trademark cannot be restricted in relation to a lawful business being conducted by a bona fide owner of the said business as long as the said trademark is not in conflict with the rights of a third party or against the provisions of any law in force at that time. Similarly, a registered trademark can also be used, even though, it has not been registered in relation to corresponding or some other services as long as the use in relation to said services does not infringe the rights of a third party or is contrary to any law being in force in the country at that time. Learned counsel for the petitioner has miserably failed to bring out a case of contempt against the respondent.","

SHEZAN SERVICES LIMITED (Now known as SHEZAN SERVICES (PRIVATE) LIMITED---Appellant
Versus
SHEZAN BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003, decided on 19th May, 2018.","25th April and 4th May, 2018.","Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, J","This Misc. Appeal under section 76 of Trademarks Act, 1940 impugns an order of the Registrar of Trademarks passed in dealing with Opposition No.218/2001 while considering the application of the respondent, registered as No.100857/29. The order on the opposition releases the application from such opposition and proceeded it for registration subject to the conditions that the word ""Shezan"" shall always be used in collaboration with either Lahore Continental, Lahore Oriental or Lahore Bakery and will always be used within the territory of Lahore Division.
2. It is the time of the appellant that they entered into the agreement with one Shezan Lahore, which was a partnership firm at the relevant time having its partners as Ch. Riazuddin and Rao Muhammad Usman, which then, with the passage of time, has taken shape of Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited, respondent No. 1 herein. Thus, Shezan Lahore in fact is a predecessor in right of the respondent Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited.
3. It is the case of the appellant that the agreement dated 19.02.1975 with their predecessor and the predecessor of respondent No.1 was in respect of two restaurants i.e. Shezan Continental at 46-Dingah Singh Building, and Shezan Oriental, 7-Dayal Singh Mansions, both at Shahrah-e-Qaid-e-Azam Lahore and a bakery to serve the above two restaurants for sale of their product. Appellant have attempted to argue that in terms of aforesaid agreement they have agreed to sell and the respondent No.1 has agreed to buy the goodwill of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery, which does not include the sale of word ""Shezan"" as trademark, either with or without logo.
 in a different city.","Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent cannot take shelter of subsection (2) of section 10 of 'Trademarks Act, 1940 as they were not concurrent user of the trademark in its actual perspective. Learned counsel for the appellant further relied upon Chapter 5 i.e. assignment and transmission of the Trademarks Act, 940 and relied upon section 29, which deals with the assignment and transmission of trademark, whether in connection with the goodwill of the business or not, and went on to argue that these two are different and distinct entities, as understood from the language of section 29, and since word 'Shezan' as trademark was never specifically assigned or transmitted, it could only be presumed that goodwill of the business of two restaurants and bakery, including the rights of trademark, was assigned under the aforesaid agreement. He has further relied upon the judgment of Additional CIT v. Kwality Frozen Foods from Indian jurisdiction of Mumbai Bench in IT Appeal No.5023 (Mum.) of 2001, which is an unreported matter, Noor Muhammad v. Civil Aviation Authority reported in 1987 CLC 393, Seven Up Company v. Deputy Registrar Trademark reported in 1937 MLD 91.
On the other hand learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has relied upon provisions of section 10(2) of Trademarks Act, 1940 and submitted that it is the honest concurrent use since 1975 that enabled the respondent No.1 to file application, referred above; before the Registrar Trademarks which was subjected to the opposition of the appellant and was disposed of in terms of the impugned order. She has attempted to argue that before 1975 the predecessor of the appellant and respondent were partners but without making an attempt to establish such relationship she relied upon the terms of the agreement dated 19.02.1975, which, per learned counsel, is sufficient to claim their concurrent use and entitlement for its registration under the law. In support of her contention, she has relied upon the case of Cluett, Peobody & Co. v. Assistant Registrar Trademark 1991 SCMR 921 which defines the concurrent use of trademark and the case of Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090. She further relied upon the judgment in the case of Levi and Volika of the Chancellery Division 1879 and the case of Crembux Limited of Chancellery Division 1928.
",Upshot of the above discussion is that the appellant has failed to make out a case calling to interfere in the impugned order as passed by the Registrar of Trademark hence the appeal is dismissed.,"The impugned decision concludes in paragraphs 14 and 15 that the respondent is using the trademark Shezan as a result of agreement of 1975 and there appears to be no moral, ethical and legal justification for the opposition of the appellant. It was further observed that the opponent/appellant had himself given the right to use the mark ""for consideration"" and the opposition to register the said mark is not tenable on account of continuous use since 1975 without any action on their part hence respondent No.1 stood qualified for the registration under section 10(2). The Registrar however restricted its use while dismissing the opposition and releasing the application of the respondent for its process of registration to two restaurants i.e. Continental and Oriental and Bakery, all of them situated within the territory of Lahore division.
In order to conclude as to whether along with goodwill the trademark ""Shezan"" was also passed on to respondent, the perusal of the terms of the agreement would be very material. In the first recital of the agreement, the company i.e. appellant stated to be carrying on business of hotel, restaurant and bakery in various towns of Pakistan including Lahore and then these three subject premises were described. In the second recital these three premises were claimed to be on rental and the respondent No.1 was given the obligation to deal with the issue of renewal of such leases. In the fifth recital of second page of the agreement, it is stated that on account of negotiations, the company i.e. appellant's predecessor has agreed to sell and the firm i.e respondent's predecessor has agreed to buy the ""goodwill"" of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery at a price which was acknowledged by the appellant/their predecessor. In term of first recital of the third page it is stated that through a separate negotiation the firm/respondent had purchased from the company/appellant against consideration the machinery and air-conditioning etc.
The covenants of the agreement also provide right to continue the business of these two restaurants and bakery and at such other places where the firm/respondent may deem fit within the territorial limits of Lahore division only under the subject name and style i.e. Shezan. However, it restricts its use in any other manner whatsoever except provided above.
The word ""goodwill"" and ""trademark"" were attempted to be treated as blood relatives. I would go on to penetrate further that in the subject case goodwill of a premises or of a place or of a business would worth nothing in case the subject and the essence of that business is extracted. If for instance a restaurant is being run successfully, it is not only premises or the infrastructure or ambiance that carries the reputation; it is the name and brand that carries the reputation too which is non-extractable part of goodwill and that may contribute towards building of a reputation. If one excludes the name of any good restaurant then it will be left with no other asset except an immovable property. The interpretation of subsection (2) of section 10 of Trademarks Act, 1940, in view of the above, cannot he restricted to a simple concurrent use irrespective of any agreement. Use of trademark under the agreement is not only permissive use but conclusive rights were being delegated and hence the use is concurrent to the use of the inventor. The subject use thus would come within honest concurrent use under the circumstances described in the agreement. It is inconceivable that the appellant would enjoy the consideration of a rental premises if the right of trademark is excluded. Certainly the consideration was for a particular territory i.e. Lahore division which was taken care of by the Registrar.
20. Had it been a case of permissive use only the appellant would have claimed a royalty for continuous use of the word/trademark, which is not the case here. It only advances the case of the respondent that the sale of goodwill includes the sale of trademark subject to its use within the territory defined therein.

","F.A. O. No. 17802 of 2019, decided on 28th March, 2019.","28th March, 2019","Amin-ud-Din Khan, J.","Through this appeal filed under Order XLII, Rule 1(r) of the C.P.C. the appellant; who is plaintiff, has challenged the order dated 16.01.2019 passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore, whereby an application for grant of temporary injunction, under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. was dismissed.
2. Yesterday, when the case was fixed for preliminary hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant was not available. The learned counsel for the respondents appeared with the permission of the Court at preliminary hearing stage, filed power of attorney and raised two objections that the appeal is barred by time and that the notice sent to the respondents in compliance with the Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. does not contain the copy of grounds of appeal, therefore, notice was defective one.
3. Mr. Ali Mohsin Qazalbash Advocate appeared along with Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat Advocate and stated that he is signatory of the notice sent to the respondents under Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. and the said notice mentioning the memo of appeal is attached and he confirms that memo of appeal was attached with the notice.
4. So far as the objection of learned counsel for the respondents with regard to the limitation is concerned; she stated that as order is dated 16.01.2019 and the respondents applied for issuance of certified copy, which were provided within a week, therefore, she has the impression that the appeal is barred by time when it was filed in this court on 26.03.2019.
5. The record was checked in the presence of learned counsel for the parties. As per certified copy of the impugned order attached with this appeal, the appellant moved an application for issuance of certified copy of the impugned order on 17.01.2019, which was prepared and delivered on 27.02.2019 and the appeal was filed on 26.03.2019. Therefore, it is within the prescribed period of limitation. Learned counsel for the respondents states that in this eventuality she will not press the point of limitation and further when the statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the grounds of appeal were attached with the notice, she will also not press the other objection.
 with contradictory witness statements.","It will be appropriate that the prayer of suit as well as prayer of the application moved under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. be reproduced. The prayer of the suit is as fellows:-
""It is respectfully prayed that this honourable Court may be pleased to pass a decree against the Defendants and and/or their chief executives, directors, secretaries, principal officer's, managers, shareholders, employees, servants, distributors, men, agents, stockists, retailers or dealers (hereinafter jointly referred to as the Defendants) in the following terms:-
a) pass a decree for declaration that the Plaintiff is the Proprietor and prior user in its own right of the trademark SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, used for retail stores on account of prior adoption and actual prior use of SAMSONITE for retail stores in class 35 for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., in Pakistan since year 2005 and AMERICAN TOURISTER thereafter for past 10 years, and that the Plaintiff is entitled under law to conduct its business of running retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., using SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER;
b) pass a decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants perpetually from using and advertising in any manner and in any media, SAMSONITE, alone or as house of Samsonite and AMERICAN TOURISTER for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., stores within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls, either themselves in Pakistan or through a franchise or distributor or licensee, agent in relation to luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc, of all types and related products or any limitation of Plaintiff's proprietary trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan, such as house of Samsonite and from committing acts of Unfair Competition in terms of section 67 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 and from passing off Defendants retail stores, services and business by using SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER as and for that of the Plaintiff.

h) costs of the suit may also be awarded; and
i) grant any other relief that this honourable Court may deem appropriate.""
The prayer made in the application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. is as follows:
""It is therefore, respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the titled suit, this honourable Court may be pleased to issue a temporary injunction restraining the Defendants from using in any manner trademark SAMSONITE alone or as House of Samsonite, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., or for store within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls and restrained from advertising trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan in any manner in any media for retail stores.
The Plaintiff also prays for an ad-interim injunction till the disposal of this application.""
","I have noticed that there is an order passed by the court of competent jurisdiction i.e. High Court of Sindh at Karachi, the operative part of the order dated 24.07.2018 is as under:-
""I have come to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have already made out a prima facie case of infringement under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, as the defendant even after submitting an undertaking before the Court is still using the identical signage in the name of ""Samsonite"" for which there is not consent of the owner/proprietor of the trademark/trade name, in relation to goods and services falling within Class 18 and 35 of the Fourth Schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004, read with Rules, 11, 71 and 88 thereof, the injunction application bearing C.M.A. No. 12935/2017 is granted and the defendant and its officers, servants and agents are restrained from infringing the Samsonite Mark and or other marks of the plaintiffs and while allowing injunction application, I direct the Defendant to immediately remove the signage being used by them in their outlets within 30 days from the date of this order and shall file a proper affidavit to that effect in the office duly executed by any of the Directors and or owners of the Defendant company.
The appellant can contest and press all its right's before the said Court and while deciding the instant application learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore has passed the order in accordance with law. When the plaintiff/appellant failed to make out a case for grant of temporary injunction while showing the necessary ingredients i.e. prima facie arguable case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss in its favour, this Court has no reason to disagree with the findings recorded by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property, Lahore in the light of case law referred to by the learned counsel for the respondents. Consequently, this appeal having no substance stands dismissed in limine.","In the Court it was admitted that the brand of Samsonite is of the respondents and appellant is the sole distributor and the appellant set up independent Samsonite Stores, therefore, the suit was filed that the exclusive store is the idea of the plaintiff/appellant. States that for a long time they after set up the independent Samsonite Stores have a right that the injunctive order be granted on the basis of acquiescence on the part of respondents. Argues that the learned trial court fell in error while refusing the grant of temporary injunction on the ground that the damages have been claimed by the appellant, therefore, no case of grant of temporary injunction.
10. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents argues that no agreement in writing or distributorship has been provided. That the appellant was seller of the products of the respondents. That under Clause 18 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the respondents are registered and under Clause 35 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the proceedings are pending, which are being resisted by the appellant. That under sections 86(c) and 76 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 protection of use is with the respondents and the respondents Nos.1 and 2 appointed the respondent No.3 as distributor in the year 2016, therefore, the suit was filed by the appellant in the Sindh High Court and a suit bearing No.2040 of 2017 was flied by the respondents before the High Court of Sindh at Karachi and the application for grant of temporary injunction was allowed vide order dated 24.07.2018. States that the suit for declaration was filed in the civil court by the present appellant at Lahore, the suit was dismissed and the appeal there against was also dismissed. A suit for damages was also filed by the appellant, which was dismissed for non-prosecution. Now it has been restored.",SA/F-18/L Appeal dismisse,Dismissed

F.A.O. No.436 of 2009, decided on 31st January, 2011.",,,"There are two restaurants located side by side at Qadafi Stadium one is owned by the appellant with registered trademark of ""Dera Restaurant"". The word ""Dera"" is in large size as compared to the 'word ""Restaurant'. The adjoining restaurant was allegedly named as ""Fazl-e-Haq Family Restaurant"" at one time but on account of appellant's success it has now been named as ""Fazl-e-Haq Dera"". The violation of appellant's registered trademark dated 28-7-2003 is alleged by the use of word ""Dera"" in the name of respondent's restaurant. The learned trial court has declined the interim relief by the impugned order dated 3-11-2009 primarily on the ground that the name of ""Fazl-e-Haq"" clearly distinguishes the said eatery from the appellant's restaurant. due to a change in law.","Learned counsel for the respondents adds that Mr. Fazl-e-Haq owns a number of other restaurants in Lahore. The signboard of each of such restaurant bears the owner's portrait. He submits that therefore no confusion or deception is caused by the use of word Dera in the name of the respondent restaurant.
Learned counsel for the appellant has relied on Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak.) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8) and Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mill (Pvt.) Limited and others (2001 SCMR 967) to support his case. The upshot of the precedents is that similarity between the trademarks adopted by the, contesting parties should be such as to create reasonable confusion and deception in the mind of as unwary purchaser.","Accordingly, subject to the outcome of the main suit proceedings, it is ordered that the name of respondent's restaurant may include the word Dera in it only if it is written in one line and in one font of equal size as ""Fazl-e-Haq Dera"". If the respondent does not comply with the direction within one month from the date of a certified copy of this order, the appellant may approach the learned trial Court for penal action against the respondent by striking out the word Dera from its name.
 

","The statutory test for infringement is laid down in section 40 of the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. If the objected trademark is identical or deceptively similar to the registered trademark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to the goods or services for which trademark is registered, then there is a case for infringement. In the present case evidence has not yet been recorded. The respondents deny that their restaurant adjoining appellant's restaurant was ever called ""Fazl-e-Haq Family Restaurant"". It is further explained that to establish bona fides, during the course of hearing, the respondent has changed the format of its name on the signboard. The words ""Fazl-e-Haq"" are now displayed in larger size so as to undo the effect of word Dera as a distinct name.
Evidence has yet to be recorded in the present case on whether there is sufficient basis for confusion and deception to be inferred in the facts of the case. However there is merit in the appellant's contention that the two establishments being located adjacently, the respondent's restaurant on account of common word in its name has a likelihood of attracting/diverting customers away from the appellant's restaurant. Accordingly, for the reason of proximity between tie two establishments there is a likelihood that word Dera in the name of respondent's restaurant would cause confusion and deception among customers. Photograph of the latest signboard installed outside the respondent restaurant during the course of the proceedings as a step to demonstrate bona fides, has been placed on record. It does not minimize the effect of the name ""Dera"" which is written in large size but in a font that is different from the one used for the name of ""Fazl-e-Haq"".
In the circumstances and for the purpose of interim relief the said notification adopted by the respondent is not satisfactory. Consequently, the respondents are not allowed to use the word Dera distinctly from the name of Fazl-e-Haq either in terms of its placement on the signboard of the restaurant or by a different font used therefor.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE ISSUED TO EIGHT (8) CAMPUSES OF DAR-E-ARQAM SCHOOLS:
","In the matter of
F. No. 281/DAR-E-ARQAM.CCP.OFT/17, decided on 8th August, 2019.
","13th March, 3rd and 22nd April, 2019.",Nil,"The Complainant in its complaint stated that its business ""Dar-e-Arqam School"" is presently known as one of the best quality education service provider in Pakistan, for which the Complainant converted his partnership business into private limited company named as ""Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited in year 2009. The Complainant initially entered into franchise agreements with the Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 which were later expired or terminated by the Complainant and no agreement was ever signed with Respondent No. 6. Furthermore, the Respondent No. 7 started their campuses with the name similar to the project name of the Complainant i.e. Tarbiyah which was brainchild of the Complainant and it was introduced in 2014 under Total Child Development Plan (TCDP). The use of Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and deceptive use of Complainant's project name ""Tarbiyah"" by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8 without any due authorization, constitutes, prima facie, violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, acts of the Respondents are not only misleading the consumers about their services but are also capable of harming business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act. with new technological evidence.","It is evident that the use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 and the deceptive use of the Complainant's project name i.e; Tarbiyah, by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8, is without any due authorization, thereby in violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, it also appears that the act of the Respondents Nos.1 to 8 is not only misleading the consumers regarding their products but it is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
5.2 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large and therefore, it is in the interest of the general public and fair competition in the market that the undertakings should be stopped from marketing their products in an unfair and misleading manner and be encouraged to resort to marketing practices which are transparent and give consumers true and correct information.
5.3 Therefore, in light of the above mentioned findings, it is recommended that show cause notices may be issued to Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 for, prima facie, violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(a)(b) and (d) of the Act.""
Based on the material available on the record i.e. the Enquiry Report, SCN and the written replies filed by the Respondents following issue arise for determination:
(i) Whether the Complaint is instituted in accordance with the law?
(ii) Whether can Commission can proceed in the matter while there is pending civil/criminal litigation between the parties at various forums?
(iii) Whether the enquiry committee proceeded with mala fide intentions and conclusion of the Enquiry Report is biased?
(iv) Whether the Respondent has violated the provisions of section 10 of the Act?

","As noted in the preceding paragraphs, it is established that the Respondents have engaged in deceptive marketing practices prohibited under section 10(2)(a), (b) and (d) read with section 10(1) of the Act. Therefore, for reasons mentioned in preceding paragraph we deem it appropriate to impose a penalty in the amount of PKR 5,000,000 (Rupees Five Million Only) on the proprietor of the Respondent institutions, collectively. In addition to the foregoing, we cannot ignore the fact, which though is discussed in Paras 6 and 7 above, however, we deems it appropriate to refer to it again that the Respondents from the first date showed reluctance in making submissions before us and got an adjournment on one pretext or the other. On the first date of hearing, despite receipt of notice much in advance, an adjournment was requested to file written reply. On the second hearing, i.e. 03rd April 2019, the authorized representative again requested for adjournment. Subsequently hearing was scheduled for 22nd April 2019 and on the said date, despite service and receipt of the notice neither anyone appeared on behalf of the Respondents nor was any written request made on their behalf or by them. Therefore, we decided to proceed ex-parte against the Respondents on 22nd April 2019 in accordance with provision to subsection (2) of section 30 of the Act read with clause (e) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 26 of the in the matter pursuant to Regulation 26(2)(e) of Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007. The foregoing attitude of delaying tactics falls squarely within the purview of clause (e) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act i.e. knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the process of the Commission to conclude the proceedings. Accordingly, in pursuance of clause (c) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act, we are constrained to impose a further penalty of PKR 500,000/-(Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) on the proprietor of the Respondents for knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the proceedings before us. The proprietor of the Respondent Institutions are directed to deposit the imposed penalty with the Registrar of the Commission, within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this order.
The Proprietor of the Respondent Institutions is also directed to publish in atleast two national daily newspapers that they have no affiliation or association with the Complainant within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this Order and to refrain from indulging in any form of deceptive marketing practices in the future and is forewarned that repeat violations may attract further stricter penalties as per the law.","The Respondents have made the submission through their written reply that filing/institution of the Complaint is questionable due to the fact that Mr. Bajwa's Breach of his affidavit as an Advocate. Although the ground raised by the Respondents is not clear, however, given the challenge made to the validity of the complaint under the provisions of the Act, we deem it appropriate to address the issue at hand. The complaint for violation of any provisions of the Act can be filed under section 37(2) of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
Section 37(2) where the Commission received from an undertaking or a registered association of consumers in writing of such facts as appear to constitute a contravention of the provision of Chapter II, it shall, unless it is of opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or is not substantiated by prima facie evidence conduct an enquiry into the matter to which the complaint relates.
23. The Legal Advisor in attendance referred to the earlier Orders In the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Kamyu.Pk reported as 2018 CLD 919, wherein while interpreting the provisions of section 37(2) and validity of the complaint observed as follows:
10. In the instant matter the proceedings were initiated on a complaint filed by Mr. Umair Ali through email dated 30th April 2015. Further perusal of the contents of the Complaint reveals that the Complainant had approached the Commission as a consumer and not as an undertaking. The competent authority also initiated the enquiry on the aforesaid complaint under section 37(2) of the Act. It needs to be appreciated that the Commission is not empowered under section 37(2) of the Act to proceed with an enquiry on the complaint of the consumer, rather, the legislature in all its wisdom has categorically outlined that the complaint is to be filed either by the 'undertaking' or 'registered association of consumers'. Before proceeding further it is relevant to refer to the definition of 'undertaking' as provided under clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
(q) ""undertaking"" means any natural or legal person, governmental body including a regulatory authority, body corporate, partnership, association, trust or other entity in any way engaged, directly or indirectly, in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services and shall include an association or undertakings;
11. The Commission in one of its recent Orders i.e. Order dated 15th December 2017 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Utility Stores Corporation of Pakistan (Private) Limited has defined the term 'undertaking', in the following manner:
""29. A bare perusal of the definition of an undertaking' leaves no doubt that it is divided in two parts. The first part of the definition takes within its folds the types of entities that can possibly exist i.e. an individual, a company, a firm, an association of undertakings, governmental entities, sector-regulators, a body corporate established under the Provincials or the Federal laws of Pakistan, a cooperative society and any other entity regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. Whereas the second part focuses on the nature of activity which is performed by them be it directly or indirectly i.e. production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services. The most important part of the second limb of the definition is that the legislature within its wisdom by using the words 'in any way' (emphasis added), has made it clear that there is no condition on the legal entity to engage in commercial or economic activity to fall within the purview of 'undertaking' for the purposes of the Act. If any legal entity or natural person is engaged in any way in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services, the said undertaking would fall within the purview of the term `undertaking'.""
12. We are cognizant of the fact that nowhere in the definition of `undertaking' the word 'consumer' is used. Upon analysis it is noticed that the term 'consumer' though is not defined under the Act, has been used in various other provisions, the instances are as follows:
a) In clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'dominant position',
b) In clause (k) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'relevant market',
c) In clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Act outlining the criteria for grant of exemptions,
d) In clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act, in the instance of deceptive marketing practices.
13. There is no doubt that apart from providing for free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity and to enhance economic efficiency, the scope of the Act is also to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices, which inter alia include the deceptive marketing practices. Although the term 'consumer' is not defined in the Act, however, in other consumer protection laws the term has been defined. It has been held by the august Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Muhammad Hussain Patel v. Habib Wali Muhammad, PLD 1981 SC 1, that definition from other statute can only be borrowed from other statutes where both the statutes are pari materia. The question is when statutes are considered pari materia, in this regard we draw guidance from the judgment of Honorable Sindh High Court reported as Murtaza Flour Mills (Private) Limited v. Federation of Pakistan and others, 1996 MLD 1273, wherein the Honourable Court has held:
...[s]tatutes in pari materia are statutes which are so related as to form a system or code of legislation and when they relate to same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things or have the same purpose or object it is only then that the statutes are called in pari material...
14. Keeping in view the above approach in mind, the consumer protections laws are framed to protect the interests of the consumers. Similarly, the Act also provides for protection of consumers, hence, we are of the considered view that the definition of 'consumer' can be borrowed from the consumer protection legislation inforce. The definitions are as follows:
(i) Subsection (3) of section 2 of the Islamabad Consumer Protection Act, 1995 has defined the 'consumer' in the following terms:
(3) ""consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment or hire purchase and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(ii) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(c) ""consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtains on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any services for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services;
(iii) Clause (e) of section 2 of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2014 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtain on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any service for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services,
(iv) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997 has defined the consumers in the following terms:
(c) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or to promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(v) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Balochistan Consumers Protection Act, 2003 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised' to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire. Purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
. It is clear from the facts available on the record that the Complainant was a consumer and the complaint was not filed on behalf of any registered association of the consumers. Since, a consumer does not fall within the purview of the definition of 'undertaking', hence, we hereby conclude that the initiation of the enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act on the basis of the complaint in question was in fact violative of the express provisions of law. We note that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint filed with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. In this regard reference is made to National Feeds Limited v. Competition Commission of Pakistan, 2016 CLD 1688.
24. In the aforesaid Order Re: Kamyu.Pk the Commission has clarified that who can file a complaint with the Commission under section 37(2) of the Act. In the instant matter, the complaint was filed under section 37(2) of the Act by Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation through one of its Director namely Mr. Akhter Bajwa and a Board Resolution as well as the Authority letter in favour of Mr. Akhter Bajwa was filed along with the Complaint. The Respondents have raised no objection on the authorization, rather an allegation has been levelled that Mr. Bajwa being an Advocate cannot do any other business. The Legal Advisor to the Commission has also highlighted that the current proceedings before this Bench pertains to violation of section 10 of the Act and the Commission and this Bench is not an appropriate authority to take any action against Mr. Bajwa in terms of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.
25. After carefully reviewing the merits and the submissions made before us vis- -vis the first issues, we agree with the submissions made by the Legal Advisor in attendance and re-emphasise that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint fled with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. The instant complaint was filed by the Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation are unquestionably an 'undertaking' in terms of clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, through its' duly authorized representative and no objection on the authority so bestowed upon Mr. Bajwa has been called into question. Instead, allegations against Mr. Bajwa has been made for violating the affidavit and the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973. 
We now proceed to address the issue No. (ii), in the matter based on the record available. There are several ongoing civil suits which primarily tempted the Respondents to raise this objection in the instant proceedings.
i. Respondent's suit in Rawalpindi,
ii. Respondent's suit in Peshawar,
iii. Respondent's suit in Islamabad,
iv. Respondent has field a revision petition before the High Court,
v. Complainant has filed a suit in the court of Intellectual Property Tribunal.
27. Mr. Farooqi while addressing this aspect has placed reliance and referred to an earlier Order passed by the Commission In the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for deceptive marketing practices, reported as 2016 CLD 105, wherein it was observed as follows:
""15. We find this argument to be without merit. Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of `res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision. As explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 of C.P.C. is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits ' pending in courts.
16. Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The relevant portion is reproduced below for convenience:
Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act XLV of 1860), and the Commission shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
17. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi-judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'Court ' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court. Furthermore, the settled interpretation of section 10 of the C.P.C. provides that for the section to be applicable, the two suits must be pending before courts of competent jurisdiction. In Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Messrs Azeem Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. for example, it was held by the Sindh High Court that where proceedings are not in the nature of a civil suit and are instead special proceedings provided for under special law, the provisions of section 10 of the C.P.C. would not be attracted.
Apart from the above, no other mala fide has been alleged by the Respondents. It is a settled principle of law that mala fide is to be proved through independent and cogent evidence, mere allegation are not sufficient. For the foregoing we place reliance on the case of Zulfiqar Ali v. Province of Punjab, reported as 2018 PLC (C.S) 842. In addition to the foregoing, we also refer to the case of Shafi Mohammad v. State, reported as 2017 YLR 317, wherein it was held that the burden of proof is on the one who alleges mala fide on part of Complainant or the investigation agency.
The issue in this case is the deceptive use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and of its project name i.e; Tarbiyah by Respondents without prior authorization. In this context, whether the information that ultimately reached the consumer is false or misleading and has the capacity to harm the business interests of the complainant under sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b), respectively and whether the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's trademark under section 10(2)(d).
","In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.

RABIA BAI---Plaintiff
 
Versus
 
ZEESHAN FAROOQI---Defendant
 
","
Suit No.89 of 2004, decided on 4th June, 2004.
 ",,,"The case of the plaintiff as disclosed in the plaint as well as in the affidavit in support of the application for grant of injunction and the counter-affidavit to C.M.A. No.726 of 2004 is that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to sell her goods/scented sweet supari/Pan Masala etc., under the trademark TASTY and had been selling such item since 1979. Initially such trademark was registered in the name of Hajiani Marium Bai from whom the plaintiff has purchased this business and the said trademark. In order to protect the exclusive proprietary right in respect of trademark TASTY the plaintiff has obtained registration of the said trademark under No.72151 in Class-30 in respect of ""supari"" etc. and the said registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes since 12-7-1980. In order to secure proprietary right the plaintiff has also obtained registration under Copyright Ordinance, 1962 on 23rd April, 1999, and has been using and applying the said trademark in the course of trade in a very peculiar, distinctive and distinguishing label design having colour scheme, design, livery and/or get-up. In the year 1986 plaintiff adopted trademark GOLD for her high quality sweet supari and trademark GOLD is being used by the plaintiff in conjunction with the house mark TASTY in a very peculiar manner in the form of a wrapper/packaging with distinctive colour scheme, design, get-up and livery (hereinafter referred to as ""Tasty GOLD""). The plaintiff has claimed that by virtue of said long use extensive and exclusive quality production she has acquired valuable reputation and goodwill and the goods manufactured by the plaintiff under the trademark and copyrighted ""Tasty GOLD"" are demanded by people within and outside the country. Due to reputation and goodwill the trademark and copyrighted work ""Tasty GOLD"" has become synonymous with plaintiff's products in the course of trade ""TASTY"" or ""GOLD"" either alone or in conjunction with any other work or feature whether of plaintiffs manufacture or not is referred to as emanating from the plaintiff only. Very recently, plaintiff came to know that certain other traders with mala fide intention to reap profits out of the goodwill of the plaintiff and in order to cause wrongful loss to the plaintiff are manufacturing and selling inferior quality products being exact imitation of plaintiff's trademark and copyrighted work ""TASTY GOLD"" Plaintiff made thorough market search and found that the defendant is using trademark ""GOLD Piece"" with exactly identical and deceptively similar packaging, design, colour scheme, get-up and livery and has also obtained cunningly registration with the Registrar of Copyright Karachi and such certificate has been issued to him on 10-1-2004 a day earlier to the filing of the opposition by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has stated that she has approached Central Copyright Board, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and has applied for issuance of certified extract of the work so registered with other necessary details.
 
Under these circumstances, the plaintiff has prayed for grant of temporary injunction till the disposal of the suit on the grounds that being the owner of registered trademark and copyright there is strong prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff, and she shall suffer irreparable loss if the injunction is not granted. The plaintiff has further stated that balance of convenience is also in favour of the grant of injunction.
 
Counter-affidavit to this application as well"" as written statement has been filed by Zeeshan Farooqi proprietor of the defendant's firm denying and disputing the claim of the plaintiff. In order to dislodge the claim of the plaintiff the defendant has stated that label used by the plaintiff consists of descriptive matter. The word ""Tasty"" appearing therein is a descriptive word within the meaning of Trademark Act, 1940 hence no monopoly rights over the word can be conferred upon any party. It has been further stated that the Registrar of the Trademark while granting the application of the plaintiff for trademark registration has imposed disclaimer upon the word ""Tasty"" as such no exclusive right accrued to the plaintiff in respect of the word Tasty within the meaning of Trademark Act, 1940. It is farther stated the trademark registration has been granted, to the plaintiff in Class 30 in respect of ""Tasty Label"". Thus in the said registration the dominant feature is the word ""Tasty"" which stand disclaimed. The defendant has further claimed that his firm has obtained registration of its goods with a label under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962 and plaintiff has no legal right 'to claim the relief. No infringement has been committed by the firm of the defendant and it is not a case of passing off the goods of the plaintiff. It has been categorically stated that label of the product of the plaintiff bears the photograph of her brother/cousin which itself constitutes a distinctive feature, and it is evident even from a cursory look at the two labels. The defendant has further stated that he is using the name ""GOLD Piece"" label for last about one year, thus, the balance of convenience is also in favour of the defendant. He has further stated that his firm has already filed trademark application No.190934 on 1-1-2004 for registration of his trademark as ""GOLD Piece"". Legal plea regarding maintainability of the application has also been raised.
 
In rejoinder to the counter-affidavit while denying the case set up by the defendant, it has been stated that by the plaintiff that use of the word ""GOLD"" which is exactly similar and deceptively identical to the registered copyright, amounts to in management of passing off. Factum of disclaimer has not been denied but it has been stated to be unjustified.
 with new evidence presented.","Learned counsel for the plaintiff has mainly contended that plaintiff is engaged in the business of sweet scented supari (betel nuts) since the year 1979 and started using the trademark ""Tasty"" in the year 1980. Thereafter, the plaintiff adopted trademark of ""Tasty GOLD"" in the year 1986, and it has been registered with the Registrar of Trademark under No.72151 and 144394 in Class-30. She has further contended that the defendant has dishonestly adopted and undertaken the use of the mark ""GOLD Piece"" under a label design, which is identical and deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. Learned counsel has referred to section 21 of the Trade Mark Act 1940 to justify the exclusive right to use such mark. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further argued that by virtue of section 21 of the Trademark Act 1940 the plaintiff has got exclusive right to use the mark and under section 23 of the Act registration is the prima facie evidence of the proprietorship whereas under section 24 of the Act, after expiration of seven years from the date of such original registration, the original registration of the trademark shall be taken to be valid in all respects unless such registration was obtained by fraud, and according to the learned counsel there is no such allegation that the registration has been obtained by the plaintiff by fraud. Learned counsel has further argued that it took about five years to complete the process of registration of the mark in 1997 though the mark was advertised in the journal and neither any opposition was filed nor its registration was objected by anybody including the defendant at any time. Learned counsel has further argued that copyright in respect of artistic work in label under word Tasty GOLD wherein the word GOLD is written in a stylized manner forming an important and prominent feature with peculiar colour scheme which is distinctive of plaintiff's product, the defendants are infringing the rights of the plaintiff in respect of the said label design by using the trademark word GOLD on their packaging in the same manner and under same colour scheme with features in the manner which forms an integral part of plaintiff's registered copyrighted work. The two labels and wrappers have been placed on record for comparison.
learned counsel for the defendant has argued that no infringement has taken place as no renewal has yet been granted and as such the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff with reference to disclaimer is distinguishable more particularly when exclusive right under section 21 of the Act in the cases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff was not subject to disclaimer. She has further argued that while granting the registration of ""Tasty GOLD"" the Registrar has imposed a condition of disclaimer that words, matters and features cannot be registered. She has further argued that no one in the trade should be allowed to exploit or monopolize the marks and features commonly used by general public. Since no distinctiveness of the label was proved hence the Registrar has already concluded that the matters, features and words cannot be registered to the exclusion of others. Learned counsel further argued that no appeal was filed challenging the decision of the Registrar against disclaimer as provided under section 76 of the Act, hence the right to use the trademark material exclusively goes away.
Learned counsel has further argued that in view of the facts of the case on record no evidence of sale of this item (Tasty Gold) has been filed and the plaintiff has relied only upon advertisement of tasty gold that too as late as in 2003. No evidence of goodwill and reputation has been filed, distinctiveness has not been proved, nothing has been shown that the defendant's use is causing harm or damage, and there is no evidence to show that the defendant has mis-presented his goods to be that of the plaintiff and his use of the mark GOLD Piece has caused deception or confusion. Learned counsel has further argued that the defendant has neither copied the label as a whole, nor its essential features or any part thereof. Plaintiff's claim on the special calligraphy of GOLD is not correct as the traders of supari are commonly using the features and other common words such as GOLD and other material to describe their goods. The use by the defendant is simultaneous. Learned counsel has further argued that in passing of cases the Court required a very high standard proof before it grants injunction in favour of the plaintiff. 
Learned counsel has denied that any infringement of copyright has taken place as the defendant is using his own label, which is registered with Copyright Registrar and the plaintiff has stated that they will prefer rectification but once the registration is granted under the Copyright Law the same cannot be disturbed by impugning it, before the Court particularly when Copyright Registrar has not been made a party.
 

 
","Thus, I have come to a conclusion that there is no prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff to justify grant of injunction. Balance of convenience also does nor appear to be in favour of the plaintiff who shall not suffer any irreparable loss if injunction is refused. Resultantly, this application is rejected and the interim order granted on 28-1-2004 and extended from time to time is vacated. In this view of the matter application under Order XXXIX, Rule 4, C. P. C. is also dismissed having become infructuous.

","The general principles laid down for grant of injunction are well-settled. Plaintiff seeking injunction has to show that there is strong prima facie case in his/her favour apart from the balance of convenience and that the plaintiff shall suffer irreparable loss if injunction is not granted. Indeed, there can be no cavil with the proposition of law as laid down in various authorities cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff but it is well-settled principle of law that each case has its own merit and the law is to be applied keeping in view the facts of each case. . In the instant case the material being sold by the plaintiff as well as a large number of other sellers under various names is an item of common use viz. scented sweet supari (betel nuts). The defendant alongwith his written statement to show that word GOLD is being used by a large number of manufacturers of Sweet Supari or Scented Sweet Supari for last many years and the labels, wrappers and packets of each manufacturers are not identical, and appear to be different from each other though having some similarity in certain cases.
 
Indeed, the fact that so many other persons are illegally and unlawfully using identical wrappers, trade mark or labels, cannot be deemed to be a valid defence, but the fact remains that a look at the wrappers, packaging, colour scheme and calligraphy of the two labels being used by the plaintiff and defendant would show that the same are neither identical nor can be said to similar in all respects, and both appear to be distinctive from each other because the wrapper being used by the plaintiff has a peculiar colour scheme and calligraphy, it also bears the photograph of the brother or cousin of the plaintiff with a blue background which is an important distinguishing feature whereas the wrapper and label being used by defendant does not bear any such photograph. Word Tasty which find place on the wrapper of plaintiff in bold letters with a particular calligraphy and colour scheme is also not available on the wrapper being used by the defendant. Moreover, the defendant has admittedly registered his design, label and packaging with the concerned authority against which no appeal has been filed by the plaintiff, hence prima facie the defendant has a lawful defence available with him to resist the prayer for grant of injunction.

","F.A.O. No. 158 of 2005, decided on 28th February, 2007.",,,"The appellant through the instant appeal has assailed the order of the Additional District Judge/Trial Court dated 27-5-2005 whereby, he accepted the application of respondent No.1 for grant of temporary injunction.
The facts giving rise to the present appeal are that respondent No.1 filed a suit for permanent injunction against the appellant and respondent No.2, under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 prayed for restraining defendants from infringing the registered trade mark and property mark ""Asia"" of respondent No.1/plaintiff. The suit was accompanied by an application for temporary injunction. The appellant contested the suit and filed written statement as well as reply to application for temporary injunction. Learned trial Court after hearing the parties proceeded to accept the application for temporary injunction, resultantly appellant No.1 was restrained from using the trade mark of ""Asia"" by adding word ""Super"" in the inner stage. Appellant was also restrained from manufacturing all items including the fans in the name and style of ""Super Asia"". Respondent No.2 was restrained from selling the items, manufactured by appellant No.1. Hence, this appeal assailing the order of the trial Court.
 with new evidence presented.","Learned counsel for the appellant at the very outset has submitted that the respondents herein opposed the registration of trade mark of the appellants ""Super Asia"" in the earlier litigation, on the identical grounds, which are now subject-matter of suit. The moot question 'whether or not the trade mark ""Super Asia"" resemble with that of respondents' trade mark ""Asia"" remained under consideration in previous litigation. It was held after comparing both ""trade marks that both trade marks are different. The findings/orders of this Court dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.199 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. M/s Mohd Din and Sons), established that the plaintiff/respondent has no prima facie case. As per provisions of Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 the decision of this Court was binding on subordinate Courts but this legal aspect was totally ignored by the learned trial Court. Learned counsel then submitted that the registered trade mark of the respondent is subject to disclaimer, which fact is evident from the perusal of registration. Learned counsel went on to argue that the word ""Asia"" being geographical name cannot be registered. Registration of trade mark of the respondent violates the provisions of sections 6 and 13 of Trade Marks Act, 1940. Learned counsel has referred to the case of Anwar Industries Limited v. Muhammad Ishaque Gondal and others (1988 CLC 489) to contend that the trade mark of the respondent, could not be allowed to monopolize a common geographical name ""Asia"". Learned counsel has submitted that the appellant's enterprise being much bigger in size, prior in business and manufacturer of a large number of products as compared to that one of the respondent, cannot be restrained from using its trade mark. He lastly summed up his assertions by submitting that while passing the impugned order learned trial Court has neglected these factors, which were essential to weigh the balance of convenience and irreparable loss.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has fully supported the impugned order. Learned counsel has submitted that the respondent is registered proprietor of Trade Mark ""Asia"" since 23-6-1965. The trade mark of appellant qua the fans is black capsulated spot on white and green background with the word ""Asia"" on it. The registered trade mark of the appellant under the name of ""Super Asia"" does not pertain to fan, it relates to manufacture of goods, other than fans. Learned counsel has submitted that order dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 finds no mention in the written statement and as such cannot be considered in the case in hand. Case of Ehtesham ud Din Qureshi v. Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation Ltd. and others (2004 MLD 361) was referred to 'support this contention. Learned counsel while discussing the scope, extent and infringement of trade mark has referred to the cases of Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others (2001 SCMR 967), Messrs Tabaq Resturant v. Messrs Tabaq Resturant (1987 SCMR 1090) and Unilever PLC v. Al-Alameen Industries (2003 CLD 623). Learned counsel has referred to the cases of M. Sikandar Sultan v. Masih Ahmad Sheikh (2003 CLD 26), Telebrands Corporation through Attorney v. Telebrands Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2006 CLD 580) and Khawaja Tahir Jamal v. Messrs A.R. Fehman Glass (2005 CLD 1768). With reference to case-law, referred, it was contended that the registration of trade mark is meant for the benefit of trader and to protect the public to be mislead or deceived, and for free enjoyment right of manufacturing and marketing products. Learned counsel lastly contended that though the trade mark of the respondent is registered subject to disclaimer yet the registered proprietor can claim monopoly in the manner in which such mark, device, word or combination was put to use. Learned counsel supported his contention by citing case of Pakistan Energy House (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Rio Chemical Company and another (2003 CLD 1531).
 
","For the foregoing, this appeal is allowed and order of the learned trial Court dated 27-5-2005 is set aside, resultantly, the application for grant of temporary injunction, filed by. the respondent, is dismissed. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial at its own merit.
Before parting with the judgment it is clarified that any observation made herein is tentative and not final, yet inevitable.
 
Office is directed to send back the record of the trial Court.
 

","The appeal, in hand, is directed against the order whereby learned trial Court accepted the application of the plaintiff/respondent and granted the relief of temporary injunction. Comparison of trade mark of the appellant with trade mark of the respondent, at this stage, would unfairly prejudice the case of either party before the trial Court. It is yet inevitable to discuss whether or not, the trade mark registered in favour of the respondent, is being infringed or the trade mark used by the appellant is deceptive, earlier decision of this Court, passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. Muhammad Din and sons) is necessary. Relevant part of judgment is reproduced hereunder:--
 
'...Respondent 1's trade mark bearing the words 'Super Asia' has device of oval embellishment in yellow, black and red colours whereas the appellant's trade mark of 'Asia' has device of dental wheel and has different colour scheme. The goods covered by the two sets of trade marks are altogether different and belong to different classes. Respondent 1 has been using the trade mark 'Super Asia' since 1976 and doing quite a good amount of business. The two trade marks are not confusing and are distinguishable. In the circumstances the Registrar had valid reason to turn down the appellant's opposition....""
 
The above judgment/order had not been assailed, before the apex Court, it has attained finality. The decision being inter se the same parties, subject-matter was substantially the same and it was decided by the Court of competent jurisdiction, after hearing the parties. Such decision/judgment in a subsequent suit is binding. It was relevant and most apt for present controversy but was surprisingly ignored by the trial Court. The appellant though has not mentioned about it in written statement, yet has not taken any contrary plea. Above referred judgment of this Court was not taken a plea in defence. Mere non-mention of earlier litigation, in written statement creates no bar. A judgment of High Court is authority, in subsequent suit, which has to be considered and is not liable to be ignored. Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 can be referred in this respect. The impugned order of trial Court whereby earlier order dated 26-10-1986 has not been taken into consideration, is not legally sustainable.
In view of definite finding of this Court that respective trade marks of the parties herein, are altogether different, not confusing and distinguishable, leaves no room to conclude that the pre-requisite of injunction order i.e. prima facie case, was lacking.
 
A bare reading of section 13, clearly reveals that disclaimers are imposed for the purpose of defining the right, under the registration and not otherwise i.e. outside the registration. The proviso clearly provides that rights in a trade mark or a part of a trademark, arise, out of registration of which a disclaimer is made. Registrar at the time of granting of the registration, registered the trademark of the respondent subject to disclaimer, considering that it was not distinctive in favour of the proprietor. It is clear from the reading of section 13 .that the Registrar is empowered to place limitations by way of disclaimers on the rights which are granted to a party applying for registration of a trademark. Disclaimers are necessary to define the rights that a proprietor acquires by virtue of the registration. The disclaimer does not affect the proprietary rights acquired in the disclaimed feature by virtue of use and 'therefore the proprietor can prevent unauthorized use of disclaimed feature by proving prior use and acquisition of reputation and goodwill. One who opposes the exclusive rights of a proprietor in the disclaimed features of trademark, either arising out of a registration or through use must, establish a higher degree of honesty of adoption of that mark by him, absence of bad faith and that the said mark is not a mark itself but only a description of goods or services which is common to trade and should be for free of use by all the traders.
 
Section 6(1)(d) prohibits registration of a trademark comprising of a geographical name. Upon review of the Trade Marks Act as a whole, it becomes apparent that the Trade Marks Act in section 6, lays down the ""distinctiveness requisite for registration"". Therefore any trademark, which does not fulfil the requirements laid down in section 6 is not considered to be inherently distinctive and therefore not registerable. It was perhaps due to the fact that Registrar considered ""ASIA"" to be a geographical name, being the name of a continent, that it was not considered to be distinctive when it was registered and therefore a disclaimer on the exclusive use of the word 'ASIA' was imposed.
 
An important point, which cannot be ignored in these proceedings is that the respondent remained aware of the use of the trade mark 'Super Asia' by the appellant, since at least the year 1993 and they had already unsuccessfully opposed the registration of 'Super Asia' in favour of the appellant. Respondent's appeal before a learned Single Judge of this Court failed and they did not assail that decision before the apex Court. On the other hand, the legal proceedings, out of which this appeal has arisen, were instituted by the respondents against the appellant in the year 2004. There is an unexplained long delay of 11 years in instituting proceedings for infringement and/or passing off against the appellant. Such unexplained delay clearly tilts the balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable loss in favour of the appellant disentitling the respondent for the grant of discretionary relief of interlocutory injunction and these important aspects have been over-looked by the learned Court below.

Versus
 
The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents
","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos.66 to 73 and 76 to 78 of 2008, decided on 4th May, 2016.",,,"Brief facts of the case are that the appellants are one of the leading global healthcare companies which inter alia are engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of toothbrushes and toothpaste. In continuation of the said line of business, the appellants, sometime in 1973, allegedly made certain important innovations in the manner of toothpaste being extruded from the mouth of a toothpaste tube onto a toothbrush, which primarily included multi-colour toothpaste. emanating from the toothpaste tubes, which typically were used only to release toothpaste in one colour (hereinafter referred to as ""speckled toothpaste slug device""), commonly known as 'slugs'. the appellants confess that speckled toothpaste containing granules of same and different colour emanating from toothpaste slug have been manufactured and marketed throughout the world by various companies including the appellants, and on their account, the speckled toothpaste slug device being used by different manufactures, cannot be held to be distinctive to any particular manufacturer and no person should be allowed to acquire monopoly or exclusive right for the use of the speckle toothpaste slug device in any manner. When such applications of the Respondent No.2 were advertised in the Trade Marks Journal, the appellants opposed grant of said applications, which oppositions were rejected by the impugned order, wherein the learned Registrar held in paragraph 31 as under:
 ""It would be just and equitable to grant right to the applicants in respect of the marks only for the applied colours and the toothpaste is no doubt descriptive and non-distinctive, however, as stated earlier that the colours combinations make them distinctive and as such the proprietors thereof should be given rights to the extent of colours for which the marks are applied for and the formation for which they have worked out. In view of the above I hereby dispose of the oppositions as under.""
After refusing the oppositions filed by the appellants, the Registrar allowed applications of the Respondent No.2, however, with certain limitation of colours, meaning thereby that Respondent No.2 though could have no monopoly in slug device per se, however, if the slug device comprises of the colours for which the registration has been obtained by the Respondent No.2, no person should be allowed to get such colour combination of slug devices. Since the instant contention of the Registrar was contrary to the assertions of the appellants that identical slug devices are being deployed by a number of manufacturers, and have thus became common to trade, no registration thereof ought to have been granted to any person.  under unusual conditions.","Global definition of a trade mark whether it is under section 2(1)(1) of the 1940 Act or under section 68(1) of the UK 1938 Act lives within the following four corners of ""a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate, a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right . . . to use the mark, whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person . . ."". This definition got more liberal under post-WTO regime, and the new set of TRIPs-complaint laws define a trade mark to mean (e.g. section 2(1)xlvii of the Pakistan Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) any mark capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. Both these definitions have a common denominator, i.e., commerce. Marks have to be put to commercial use, i.e., put in the course of trade.
When these slug devices which are pictorial representations of the goods itself, were put up for registration as a trade mark, trade mark experts asked a question. Could a picture of the good (i.e. toothpaste) itself be said as use of the good in the course of trade? Since no one would be able to see the toothpaste until he purchases it, takes it home and squeezed it! As the very function of a trade mark is to depict connectivity of the product with its provider, such badge of origin has to be obvious to a purchaser so that he can put his hands on the desirable product. Once a product is purchased, the consumer has already married to the product and any further attributes attached to the product become of secondary value as the transaction has already been consummated, therefore what comes out from the open end of a toothpaste once a person squeezes it is a post-purchase experience and the invisible stripes are of no trade mark value as they are also devoid of any distinctive character, which is a prerequisite for a trade mark to be registered.","For the various reasons cited hereinabove, I am of the view that the marks consisting of slug devices (being combinations of stripes, speckles and colors - while seen as the arrangement of the product itself, or mere decoration, or even as indicating any ingredients in the toothpaste), fail to distinguish the applicant's goods and therefore do not function as a trade mark and are thus debarred from registration.
For the above reasons, the instant appeals are allowed and the impugned order is set aside.
Office is directed to make a copy of this judgment and place the same in each of the MA files, and send a copy of this judgment to the Registrar of Trade Marks, for publication in the electronic version of the forthcoming Trade Marks Journal.","Section 6(e) of the 1940 Act essentially requires distinctiveness in the mark in order for granting registration to the mark. Trade marks devoid of any distinctive character are not accorded any place on the register. Test for finding distinctive character was summarized in the Henkel's Application, SRIS O/152/01, as well as, in the case of Yakult Honsha KK's Trade Mark Application reported as 2001 RPC 756 where Justice Laddie held that ""the fact that a particular design is eye-catching because it is unusual or decorative is not enough by itself. At all times the Registry has to ask whether the design is distinctive as a badge of origin ...... the fact that a container is unusual or attractive does not, per se, mean that it will be taken by the public as an indication of origin. The relevant question is not whether the container would be recognised on being seen a second time, that is to say, whether it is of memorable appearance, but whether by itself its appearance would convey trade mark significance to the average customer. For the purpose of this appeal, I am prepared to accept that the bottle shape is both new and visually distinctive, meaning that it would be recognised as different to other bottles on the market. That does not mean that it is inherently distinctive in a trade mark sense."" One can easily gather from the above guidance that for a mark to have a distinctive character, a customer, when looking at the product on a second time, should be able to connect the product to his past experiences with the instant product, which means, notwithstanding the eye-catching nature of the design, the product has to be re-recognised on being seen on the second time. It is not very hard to deduce from the above that the visual or sensual contact with the product is very critical for a purchaser to distinctively remember it and recall images of the identical product purchased by him in the past. 
For similar slug devices trade marks filed in the UK, the applications were refused by the Comptroller General with the following observations:
""In my view the sign applied for will not be taken as a trade mark without first educating the public that it is a trade mark. It follows that this application is debarred from prima facie acceptance by Section 3(1)(b) of the Act.""
The Swiss Supreme Court also in 2005 upheld a decision not to register the shape of a slug of toothpaste as a trade mark.
Before I proceed towards conclusion, I find it relevant to mention the case of ""Intel Inside"", which (one could say) has somewhat relevancy with the instant scenario where the discussion is held about trade mark applied to goods which are not visible to the customer. Intel Corporation is one of the leading manufacturer of integrated circuits and microprocessors. Intel realized that since its trade mark hidden from the eyes of the purchaser directly, it should arrange to put ""Intel Inside"" on the packaging of the products wherein Intel microprocessors were used, to covey to the public that the products they are intending to purchase, use Intel's microprocessors.
As mentioned in the foregoing, even though (by and large) end consumers do not themselves buy Intel products as such, the company's success in persuading computer manufacturers to use the ""Intel Inside"" mark on the exterior body of the computers contributed to the huge reputation of the said trade mark resulting that anyone who sees the said mark used in relation to computers or computer-linked products or services takes it as denoting a trade connection with appellant. To the contrary, the case in hand is about natural outflow of toothpaste mass from the tube as the tube is squeezed, and the nature and color of the slug device emanating from the tube, in my view, do not make any trade connection with the manufacturer of the toothpaste, thus such devices could not be held as trade marks, or to have any secondary meaning.","

","Suit No. 20 and C.M.A. No. 83 of 2018, decided on 8th October, 2018.",nil,nil,"The Defendant, through the instant application, challenged the grant of an Ad Interim Injunction which had restrained the Defendant, its agents, representatives, distributors, and employees from using the trademark/trade name ""Brands 4 Less"" and associated logo/artistic work, or from marketing, promoting, trading, and selling products under this trademark/trade name. This challenge is based on the grounds that the Plaintiff has not disclosed any valid cause of action against the Defendant, that factual and legal inaccuracies exist in the Plaintiff’s case, and that pertinent information was withheld to sway the Tribunal. The Defendant asserts prior use of the trademark since 2007-2008 and an attempted registration in 2009, which was abandoned due to lack of legal expertise. in a different city.","The main issue revolves around whether the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 should be vacated. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff lacks a prima facie case, the balance of convenience does not favor the Plaintiff, and there is no likelihood of irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. The Defendant also asserts prior use and registration attempts for the trademark.","The Tribunal finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated a case for the continuance of the interim injunction. It highlights that owning a well-known mark does not absolve the Plaintiff from proving all necessary elements for injunctive relief. Consequently, the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 is vacated, and the suit is ordered to proceed without the injunction in place.","The Tribunal’s reasoning includes an evaluation of whether all three essential criteria for granting an injunction—prima facie case, balance of convenience, and likelihood of irreparable damage—are met. It reviews the legal standards for granting injunctions, particularly focusing on the principle of ""Dilution"" and whether the Plaintiff’s mark qualifies as a well-known mark under the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001.

","Crl. Org. No. 28 of 2016, decided on 19th February, 2016.",,,"Through this criminal original, the petitioner has prayed for initiating contempt proceedings against the respondent for allegedly disobeying the order of this Court dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondent had given an undertaking before this Court which is recorded in its order dated 01.06.2015 passed in F.A.O. No.29 of 2015 that he will confine his business under his trademark (Mark-A) which is registered in respect of goods and not in relation to providing services. He further submits that as the trademark of the respondent is only registered for goods, he cannot use it ostensibly for restaurant services etc. with a different defendant.","When quarried as to whether there is any prohibition under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, or any Act or law which is applicable in Pakistan to prevent use of an unregistered trademark or a service mark, learned counsel cannot point out any such provision or law. The Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 lays down provisions for registration of 'trademark' as well as 'service mark'. If an original owner of a trademark fails to register its trademark in relation to its services, he cannot be taken to task for that failure. The respondent is not infringing the trademark of the petitioner or the rights of any other person rather in the previous round of litigation in F.A.O. No.29/2015 it was the respondent who claimed infringement of his trademark by the petitioner. In that appeal, the petitioner was found at fault as such, he was directed to make changes in his trademark in order to prevent confusion and deception amongst the consumers/general public.","This criminal original is, therefore, dismissed with a cost of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand only) to be deposited by the petitioner in the Dispensary of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, within one month from the date of this order, receipt whereof will be deposited with Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court for placing on this file, otherwise it would be collected as arrears of land. Office will place this file in the Chamber on May 23, 2016 as a ""compliance case"".
","Be that as it may, I find that no undertaking was given by the respondent before this Court on 01.06.2015 in F.A.O. No.29/2015 for not using its registered trademark in relation to services. The bona fide use of an unregistered trademark cannot be restricted in relation to a lawful business being conducted by a bona fide owner of the said business as long as the said trademark is not in conflict with the rights of a third party or against the provisions of any law in force at that time. Similarly, a registered trademark can also be used, even though, it has not been registered in relation to corresponding or some other services as long as the use in relation to said services does not infringe the rights of a third party or is contrary to any law being in force in the country at that time. Learned counsel for the petitioner has miserably failed to bring out a case of contempt against the respondent.","

Messrs AZHAR ENTERPRISES through Proprietor---Respondent
 

","R.F.A. No.108 of 2000, decided on 30th March, 2009.",,,"Messrs National Tool Industry (Registered), appellant herein instituted a suit before learned District Judge, Rawalpindi under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for permanent injunction and recovery of damages against the respondent. The respondent contested the suit and out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, 7(seven) issues were framed and the evidence of the parties was recorded in response thereto. Learned District Judge, Rawalpindi on conclusion of the trial, vide his judgment and decree dated 9-5-2000, dismissed the writ of the appellant, holding therein that the trade mark used by the defendant is distinct, leaving no similarity with the trade-mark of the respondent. While reaching the said conclusion, it was observed by the learned Court that the appellant has failed to prove that anyone has been deceived by the trademark of the defendant. with new evidence presented.","Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that tine appellant is a registered proprietor of the trademark vide Serial No.79351 with effect from 2-4-1983. The appellant is selling shovels bearing the trademark of one cancel and falls in the category of Tools and Instruments thrilling part of clause 8 of schedule 2. The defendant's trademark is identical in every respect to that one of the appellant's except that it contains two camels. He has added that Issues Nos.2 to 4 were decided in the impugned judgment in favour of the appellant; plaintiff and the findings of learned trial Court qua issues Nos.1, 5 and 6 were against the plaintiff/appellant which are now assailed in this appeal. Learned Court has failed to ascertain the fact that both the trade marks so merely resemble that there is every likelihood to deceive the customer. He added that when get-up is so close that it can be ascertained, merely on it's cursory look, no evidence of deception is needed. It was argued that in the comparison of trademarks, the Court has to examine and decide the controversy from various angles namely similarity and dissimilarity of trademarks, over all get-up and to find that unwaried purchasers can be deceived in view of close resemblance. The issue of deception can be decided by comparing both the trademarks side by side. Learned counsel submitted that U.W.2, in his cross-examination has admitted that trademark is pasted around the handle of the shovel horizontally. He then submitted that when trademark is pasted around the handle one camel disappears and the other becomes conspicuous. Learned counsel while discussing the evidence has submitted that D.W.1 appeared himself and D.Ws Nos.2 to 4 are the shopkeepers of Mochi Bazar, Rawalpindi. They slated that there was no complaint from the customers that they wanted to purchase the shovel with one camel but the shovel having the trademark of two cancels was sold to them. Learned counsel submitted heat no purchaser was brought to witness box but the sellers who sell the shovels of the defendant/respondent. The witnesses are interested witnesses and their statement cannot be relied upon.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has submitted that the appellant is manufacturing shovel with it's trademark ""single camel"" and the same is registered. While the respondent is manufacturer of shovel carrying the label of ""two camels"". He went further to argue that onus to prove issues Nos.3 to 6 was on the plaintiff who failed to prove the same. P.W. 1 the star witness has not stated anything towards infringement of the trademark. He added that it was a primary responsibility of the appellant to prove infringement of the brand/label. There is remarkable difference between the two brands. The brand of the appellant conspicuously mentioned name of it's manufacturer ""National Tools"" while the brand of the respondent contains the name of it's manufacturer ""Azhar Enterprises"". The buyer, through a glance at the brand name, earl differentiate between the two. Learned counsel while referring to the case of ""Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd."" 1989 SCMR 361 contended that primary test to decide whether a trademark which was owned by another has become publics juris is to sec whether it's use by other persons is still calculated to deceive the public. Learned counsel then contended that where an unwary user is likely to be deceived, is the test wherefrom infringement of the trademark can be ascertained. Mere similarity of competing trademarks is not enough. What has to be adopted is that both the trademarks are so striking that an unwary purchaser would be deceived. Learned counsel in support of his contention has referred to the cases of ""Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another"" PLD 1984 SC 8, ""Insaf Soap Factory v. Lever 13rothers Port Sunlight Ltd."" PLD 1959 (W.P.) Lahore 381 and Bandenawaz Ltd. v. Registrar of Trade Marks. Karachi and another"" PLD 1967 Karachi 492. Learned counsel submitted that trademark should not be placed side try side to land out the similarity. He added that both the brand of trademarks should not be compared side by side as alleged by the appellant but infringement has to be tested while comparing one mark in the absence of outer. He supported his contention from the dictum laid down in the case of 'The Welcome Foundation Limited v. Messers Karachi Chemical Industries (Private) Limited"" 2000 YLR 1376.","The claim of the appellant for damages is permissible only when the damages claimed are asserted in the suit under each head separately and proved through cogent evidence. The appellant has failed to prove damages and his claim has rightly been declined by learned trial Court. Thus, the appeal to this extent is dismissed.
For the foregoing, this appeal is partially allowed, the judgment and decree of learned trial Court qua dismissal of the claim of the appellant for infringement of trademark is set aside, the suit of the plaintiff is decreed for permanent injunction, restraining the respondent from infringing the appellant's registered trademark. Parties are left to bear their own costs.

","Learned counsel for the respondent mainly defended the impugned judgment and decree of learned trial Court on the plea that the infringement of a registered trademark is essentially proved from evidence showing that get up of two trademarks/brands is similar and there is every likelihood of deception by an unwary purchaser. A plaintiff has to lead evidence in this regard and in the absence of such evidence, suit is not liable to be decreed. The contention of learned counsel for the respondent is not convincing. Similarly the observation of the learned Court, is that the plaintiffs failure to produce witness deposing that he fell victim to misunderstanding because of similarity of the trademarks is not well founded. The plaintiff was non-suited on this sole reason/plea, erroneously. Section 21 of the Trade Marks Act, 194.0 is relevant which reads as under:--
 
""21(1) Subject to the provisions of sect ions 22, 23 and 26, the registration of a person in the register as proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trademark or a registered riser thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it. as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either--
(a) as being used as a trade mark; or
(b) to import a reference to some person having the right either as a proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.""
Perusal of the above provision of law reflects that the legislature in it's own wisdom has used the terms ""likely to deceive"" and ""cause confusion"". The term ""likely to deceive"" is wide enough to negate the stance of' the respondent drat absolute proof is needed to make out a case of infringement of trademark. A plaintiff can establish the case of infringement of trademark, by proving that impugned trademark has caused confusion or it so nearly resemble with registered trademark that there is likelihood of it's deception, without calling the witness in the witness box, who was so deceived.
 
Necessity of leading evidence to prove the infringement of trademark came up for consideration before the superior Courts and the issue was examined in the following cases, as under:--
(i) The Privy Council in the case of ""Lever v. Goodwin"" (1887) 36 Ch. D.1) observed that in the matter where there is no evidence that no one has in fact being deceived is immaterial. It is not necessary that there should be evidence that no one in fact had been deceived. It is enough it the plaintiff satisfies the Court that lire defendant's goods marked in the manner so as to lead the purchaser to believe that there being the goods of the plaintiff.
(ii) In the case of ""Messrs Burney's Industrial and Commercial Company Limited v. Rehman"" PLD 1983 Kar.357, Honourable Sindh High Court observed that evidence of an expert witness or an intelligent customer or even a customer of average intelligence who takes ordinary care while buying goods in the market, world not be relevant as the lest is that of an unwary purchaser and it is only the evidence of an unwary purchaser which would be relevant. Learned Court went further and observed that some witnesses for the plaintiff, in a trademark infringement action, may state that they were deceived by the infringing mark whereas other witnesses giving evidence for the defendant may depose to the contrary. It may, therefore, be observed that invariably the Court, alter taking into consideration the two marks, the registered and the infringing, decide whether the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to he deceived.
Survey of above case-law and the provisions of section 21 of the Act, 1940 (now repealed) brings me to conclude that infringement of trademark cannot be proved through bringing the buyers in the witness box. Each side can lead the evidence of it's own choice and pass through the test of cross-examination. The Court can examine the material relevant evidence and two marks and decide that the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to be deceived.
Learned Court has non-suited the plaintiff and dismissed the suit on the solitary ground that no witness was produced in evidence to prove that at the time of purchase he (the witness) was deceived. Learned Court has not only committed material irregularity while reaching this conclusion but has neglected to follow the law settled through various judgments of the superior Courts. The impugned judgment and decree is based on wrong assumption of law and as such it is not sustainable.
Now, I will advert to the instant controversy. On mere examination of both the trademarks, it is evident that colour scheming, border, design and get up, is similar and closely resembled. Normally, in a picture sky is portrayed in blue while soil/ground is shown as green. In the registered trademark, the background is yellow and ground is red with grey strips. The respondent has dishonestly followed the same pattern and used the same colour scheme, opting to make his label identical and similar to that one of the appellant. No doubt that both the labels are worded differently. The label of the appellant comprises of the word ""Improved"" while the respondent's, label carries the words ""'Two Camels"". The address mentioned in the former label is National Tool Industry Chowk Kotli Behramji Sialkot No.3, while Azhar Enterprises Umar Road, Rawalpindi is the address mentioned in the latter label. Lower portion of both the labels is similarly worded. Both the labels comprise three parts and their colour scheming and size create the element of deception. No matter both the labels are examined side by side, or one in the absence of other. The deception becomes more conspicuous when the label is affixed at the handle of the shovel, which is round in shape. If infringing label is fixed at the top of the handle one of the camels becomes invisible and gives impression of one camel instead of two camels. An unwary purchaser in the instant case is whether a farmer or a labourer or an illiterate person, as the tool is meant for this class of users. Such class of purchasers cannot distinguish the label by the English words used therein. They normally purchase the product by device or get up. This aspect cannot be ignored.

Suit No. 516 of 2015, heard on 22nd April, 2016.",,,"Brief facts of the plaintiff's case as contended are that they are insurance company incorporated on 29.6.1995 and was renamed as New Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited in October 2004. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in order to distinguish its high quality insurance services from other insurance companies they have adopted and coined number of distinctive service marks including the service mark ""Amaan Plan"" which are protected under the trademark laws in Pakistan. Such mark was registered on 24.7.2014 having registration No. 338428 in class 36 for the services which include insurance, financial affairs, monetary affairs and real estate affairs. It is contended that such service mark was adopted in the year 2007 for the insurance policies which were issued to different individuals which are available as annexure-G onwards. It is contended that with the passage of time such service mark has gained popularity and the number of policies were issued since 2007 and business gained momentum since then.
Learned Counsel submitted that by virtue of continuous and extensive use the service mark has earned reputation and goodwill. He contended that by virtue of prior adoption and continuous use of the mark since 2007 the plaintiff has presented himself as bona fide proprietor and owner of the service mark. It is argued that for the first time in September 2014 it came in the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendant started insurance policies under the plaintiff's registration mark ""Amaan Plan"" hence formal letter was issued to them which was replied and they were subsequently informed that they have obtained registration of the trademark ""Amaan Plan"" in the form of logo. Learned Counsel submits that despite the notice/letters the defendant did not stop the infringement of the plaintiff's registration and hence they have issued a legal notice. It is argued that the impugned mark is deceptively similar which is likely to mislead and cause confusion to the innocent customers and general public. Thus learned Counsel submitted that the defendant be restrained from using plaintiff's registered service mark ""Amaan Plan"" or ""Amaan"" and sought declaration that the service mark ""Amaan"" alone is deceptively similar and amounts to infringement of plaintiff's registered service mark.
The defendants have filed their respective replies.  Learned counsel has taken me to a letter issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan wherein the SECP has allowed them to transact Classes of window takaful business as specified. Learned Counsel has taken me to the definition of ""insurance"" and ""takaful"" and urged that there is huge difference between two services and hence there could not be a confusion in the minds of the customers since two products are different. Learned Counsel submitted that the plaintiff deals in the life insurance policies whereas the takaful is not at all meant for life insurance. Learned Counsel has relied upon the definition of conventional insurance business as provided under sub-Rule (iv) of Rule 2 of the Takaful Rules, 2012. Learned Counsel has added that they deal in all kinds of takaful other than life insurance such as fire takaful, marine takaful, motor takaful, engineering takaful and miscellaneous takaful and none of the above is a conventional insurance either life or non-life and hence they are neither identical nor similar services as compared to the plaintiffs' service ""Amaan Plan"" and the question of infringement does not arise. with new technological evidence.",At the very outset the counsel for the defendant does not object to the similarity of the mark and the only reason assigned to the use of such .registered trademark is that the services provided by the plaintiff is dissimilar to the services in question trademark provided by the defendant.,"In my view the defendants have failed to justify bona fide adoption of the word, ""Amaan Plan"" and/or ""Amaan"" as they may have other choices instead of plaintiff's registered mark which has already gained popularity and enjoying a goodwill in the market, hence I am of the view that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, balance of inconvenience is also in their favour and they would suffer irreparable loss unless the application is allowed as prayed. Accordingly the application is allowed.
","It is the case of the defendant that they are dealing with takaful whereas the plaintiff's service is limited to the extent of life insurance policies and hence the two customers are not common. The definition of ""similar services"" provided under the trademark laws are of importance while deciding the question under reference. Section 2 subsection (xlv) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides definition of ""similar service"" which reads as under:-
""S.40(xlv): ""Similar services"" included services which are of the same description;

Section 39 of the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 relates to the rights conferred by registration whereas section 40 of the Ordinance deals, with the infringement of the registered trademark. In terms of section 40 subsection 3(c) of the Ordinance a person shall infringe a registered trademark if the person uses in the course of a trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trademark in relation to services of the same description as that of service in respect of which a trademark is registered. The proposition thus appears to be simple that service which is being dealt with by both the plaintiff and the defendant whether is of same description or otherwise to attract the provisions as referred above. I may refer to the international classification of goods and services and it seems that it is being dealt with by class-36 and there is no dispute in this regard as the defendant himself chooses to apply under the same class. The defence that they have been dealing with takaful business would not turn much as it is being dealt with by the same classification. Where may not be any doubt that the takaful business may not be of conventional insurance but the question arises as to why a proprietary right for a registered mark could be allowed to infringe by the defendant who provide services of the same class i.e. class 36 which may, cause confusion in the mind of the customers. Another answer to a question that the plaintiff is dealing with life insurance policies whereas defendant is not, the word ""Amaan Plan"" of the plaintiff has gained so much popularity that the customers who may wish to have other policies of the plaintiff could be deceived by the mark of the defendant as they would presume that the plaintiff has also started dealing with other kinds of policies. The provisions of section 40 of, the Ordinance are thus clear insofar as the entitlement of the plaintiff is concerned. The defendant has not shown any reason plausible at law as to why they have chosen an invented word of the plaintiff which has gained popularity since 2007 which is not denied by the defendant. Considering the background of the plaintiff's business, it seems that the adoption of the same trademark which is phonetically and visually similar and there is likelihood that it would create confusion and deception to the Customers of such class. There is no specific provision available in the Trademark Ordinance for the registration of service mark as takaful service. The license obtained from SECP for takaful service does not meant for the infringement of the plaintiff's registered mark nor does it allow the defendant to act in such manner.",SL/J-12/Sindh Application allowed.,Allowed.

PEPSICO INC. and 4 others   Respondents
 

","Civil Appeal No.1356 of 1999, decided on 12th. August, 2004.
 
(On appeal from the order dated 1 10 1999 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore in F.A.O. No. 122 of 1999).",,,"Pepsi Cola Inc., a North Carolina Corporation, Executive Offices, 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577; U.S.A. (hereinafter to be referred to as Pepsi Cola Company) on 26th day of June, 1993, entered into an agreement captioned as Exclusive Bottling Appointment with Bolan Beverages (Pvt.) Limited, B 98/100, Quetta Industrial Estate, Quetta, Pakistan (hereinafter to be referred to as Bolan Bottlers). Through such agreement Pepsi Cola Company appointed Bolan Bottlers to bottle, sell and distribute their product known as and sold under the trademarks PEPSI COLA and PEPSI, solely within the limits of the Province of Balochistan described as ""Territory.""
 
The term of such appointment initially was for a period of five years commencing from the date of appointment. After the expiry of initial terms this appointment was to be automatically extended for additional terms of 5 years each unless either the Bolan Bottlers or the Pepsi Cola Company should give notice in writing to the other party of its intention not to renew the agreement or of the terms under which such appointment shall be renewed. Such notice was to be given at least one year in advance of the expiration of the original term of five years or of any additional term. Bolan Bottlers accepted the   appointment upon the terms contained in the agreement (pages 162 to 172) to bottle, sell and distribute the beverage only for ultimate resale to consumers within the ""territory"" and not without either directly or indirectly. Clause 2 of the agreement was incorporated to provide that Pepsi Cola Company will sell either directly or through its subsidiaries to Bolan Bottlers and the latter will purchase all units of Pepsi Cola concentrate required for the manufacture of the beverage known as Pepsi Cola the world over. A Unit of Pepsi Cola concentrate was of fixed quantity while the price thereof was US $ 1150.
 
Such bottling appointment issued on 26 6 1993 was intact when Pepsi Cola Company, vide letter dated 7 12 1998, cancelled the exclusive bottling appointment. On 16 12 1998, Bolan Bottlers filed a civil suit against Pepsi Cola Company and its various divisions for a declaration to the effect that the cancellation was void and unlawful and further that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and hence it could not be revoked unilaterally by Pepsi Cola Company. An injunction was also sought against Pepsi Cola Company to the effect, inter alia, that Bolan Bottlers be allowed to continue the business and Pepsi Cola Company be restrained from taking any action against the bottlers and under the Trade Marks Act, till the final decision of the suit. As the agreement stood already cancelled; we would better comprehend it to be a temporary mandatory injunction. In the alternative, Bolan Bottlers claimed a sum of Rs.985 million as damages with the assertion that the exclusive bottling appointment stood automatically renewed for another period of five years with effect from 26 6 1998.

The suit was strongly opposed by Pepsi Cola Company calling it to be counterblast to their suit before the High Court of Sindh and seriously alleging that Bolan Bottlers had been guilty of grave violation of terms of appointment and that under the terms thereof the cancellation was but unavoidable. The application filed by the plaintiff under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 read with section 151, C.P.C. was strongly resisted. The learned trial Court, vide its order dated 20 4 1999, allowed the application and granted all the interim reliefs contained in the application. Being aggrieved of the aforesaid order, Pepsi Cola Company filed F.A.O. No. 122 of 1999, whereupon an Hon'ble Single Judge of Lahore High Court recalled the interim injunction through order dated 11 10 1999 and hence Bolan Bottlers filed a petition for leave to appeal, which was granted by this Court on 20 10 1999 to consider various aspects of the case specially that the High Court while recalling the interim injunction, whether or not had complied with the law laid down by this Court in Muhammad Aref Effendi v. Egypt Air 1980 SCMR 588, and whether an injunction in such like cases can be granted, even, when the plaintiff has laid down substantial money claim in shape of damages.
 

 under heightened security.","Mr. Tariq Mehmood, learned counsel for the appellant while describing the agreement between the parties as ""franchise"" based his case on three fold grounds. Firstly, that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and therefore, the contract could not be revoked unilaterally under section 202 of the Contract Act. Secondly, that the grounds of cancellation were frivolous and no notice of revocation had been issued. Thirdly, that the duration of agreement had stood automatically extended to ten years before which the cancellation could not be made. A judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No.518 of 1994 (Beecham's case) decided on 7 8 2000 was placed reliance upon. A perusal of the judgment would indicate that the point of law settled therein was, as to, whether clause 12 of the agreement was governed by clause 13 of the agreement or vice versa. The case was argued from another angle as well. Learned counsel for the respondent Company laid sufficient stress on the fact that the Company has already revoked the agreement and stopped the sale of concentrate to Bolan Bottlers. That if any temporary injunction is granted now in their favour, it would amount to a mandate whereby such revoked contract would be trusted upon the respondent. . Our attention has been invited to another important aspect of the case not adequately rebutted by the opposite side. Learned counsel for the respondent has referred to various tests conducted qua the product sold in the market. It was put to four different tests whereafter it transpired that the Bottlers have been using the concentrate of `RC Cola' and were selling it under the name, style and trademark of `Pepsi Cola'. This is alleged to be a serious violation of the trademark in selling a product available for half the price of Pepsi Cola. 
Learned counsel for the appellant seriously objected to the manner in which various samples of the product were procured and sent to the laboratory. He was of the view that a spurious product in the market could have been manufactured by any other violator of the trade mark in the market and hence the availability of a spurious Pepsi Cola cannot be an exclusive prove of the fact that it was produced by Bolan Bottlers. ","Consequent upon what has been discussed above, there being no merit in the appeal, it is hereby dismissed, the order of the High Court is maintained and the temporary injunction prayed for by the appellant/ plaintiff is hereby refused.
 

 
","As franchise is not defined in our own Contract Act, we may have a reference to Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition page 658, where franchise is defined as ""a privilege granted or sold, such as to use a name or to sell products or service. The right given by a manufacturer or supplier to a retailer to use his product and name on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon."" In its simplest terms, a franchise is a licence from owner of trademark or trade-name permitting another to sell a product or to serve under that name or mark. Precisely this definition is more akin to a licence rather than an agency. What exists between the present parties is more suitable to be determined in the light of the agreement itself and then the relevant laws on the subject.
 
From the perusal of the agreement in question dated 26 6 1993 (pages 162 to 172) it would be clear that the very heading given to the agreement was neither licence nor agency but it was captioned as ""Exclusive Bottling Appointment"". Though the headings or the captions cannot exclusively determine the nature of a contract yet the various clauses thereof would be material in determining the real nature of the agreement. It would not be convenient to reproduce the entire agreement yet the material clauses thereof would be referred to at the appropriate places. Clause 2 defines the role of the parties where Bolan Bottlers is a purchaser of Pepsi Cola concentrate while  Pepsi Cola Company is the seller thereof. Clause 3 of the agreement further lays down that the trademark shall be the exclusive property of Pepsi Cola Company not subject to question by the Bottler. The seller shall protect the trademark and shall not be liable to the Bottler for any loss or damage suffered by Bottler's use of the trademark. This indicates beyond doubt that in this agreement the Bolan Bottlers would have no right or interest in the trademark or in the registration thereof or any designs, copy rights, patents etc. mentioned above.
Section 211 of the Contract Act describes the agent's duty in conducting the principal's business. Whether the business agreed upon between the parties before us is the one of the principal or of the agent remains to be determined in the light of the agreement. According to the agreement, the entire business belongs to the Bolan Bottlers and not the Pepsi Cola Company. In terms of the provisions of section 182 and 211 of the Contract Act, we believe that, prima facie, the agreement between the parties does not constitute an agency either. In the instant case Bolan Bottlers, as per agreement, is not bound to render any account to Pepsi Cola Company on demand. Section 216 of the Contract Act explains the principal's right to benefit gained by agent dealing on his own account in business of agency. Sections 217 and 218 of the Contract Act also lay down certain conditions that the agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account. In case before us, the Bolan Bottlers never received from the third persons any amount or account on behalf of or for the Pepsi Cola Company. The agreement viewed in the light of the text law, prima facie, indicates the existence of no agency.

We hold in the light of the above discussion, that an agent is a hyphen that joins and a buckle that binds the relation between the principal and the third party. Where a person is not liable to the principal for the submission of accounts such person cannot be dubbed as agent. In the instant case, the product known as Pepsi Cola is sold to the third party as the  property of Bolan Bottlers without any control of Pepsi Cola Company and hence it prima facie lacks the necessary ingredients of an agency. The Bolan Bottlers also do not receive any commission for the sale, rather, they receive the entire amount of sale consideration as well as the profits. 
The first portion of the section is clearly indicative of the fact that either the agent must have an interest pre existing in the property or creation of such interest should be the direct result of the agreement itself. In the instant case, the interest of the parties is only to the extent of sale by one and purchase by the other. Everything comes to an end the moment the sale is completed. The case of the appellant is that after such agreement the Bolan Bottlers constructed offices, employed numerous persons and hence a clear interest was created. This, we are afraid, all the infrastructure which has been constructed and prepared by the appellant is for the promotion of his own business which he commenced in order only to earn his own profits which are never to be shared by the respondent i.e. the Pepsi Cola Company.
After having gone through the law on the subject, we are of the view that only that agency is irrevocable which is created with adequate consideration and is designed to serve as security for some interest of the agent. Any expenditure in setting up office and necessary infrastructure for carrying on business of agency does not tantamount to the creation of interest of agent in the subject matter. To elaborate, we may mention that creation of tenancy or the grant of lease is tantamount to the creation of agency because a tenant or lessee by virtue of the very agreement of lease or tenancy becomes directly interested in the subject matter of lease etc. The interest of a person is created only where the authority is given for the purpose of being a security or is a part of the security and not to cases where such authority is independent and the interest of donee is created afterwards and incidental to the factum of sale etc. An act, of sale of consumer goods does not create an authority coupled with interest. We hold in view of the law coupled with the terms of agreement before us that it does not create an interest of the purchaser by itself and hence prima facie the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted. 
We also believe and hold that in the circumstances of the present case and in the light of section 21(a) read with section 56(f) of the Specific Relief Act, the instant one is not a fit case for the grant of temporary injunction. 
In order to reinforce the argument the learned counsel referred us to .numerous pages of Papers Book V showing the graph of sale of Pepsi Cola concentrate having been purchased by Bolan Bottlers during previous years. This background of sale of concentrate has remained reasonable and constant during early years but for six months next before the institution of suit no concentrate has at all been purchased, whereas, the product is constantly being sold in the market. It is not known as to how could the product be marketed, if genuine, when no concentrate at all is purchased. The obvious conclusion, 'prima facie, would be that some spurious product is marketed and the same is accepted as well in few of dispatches on record. In these circumstances, if a temporary injunction is granted, what assurance would there be that no spurious or unhygienic material shall be sold during the existence of the injunction. It is a case where, by sale of spurious goods, a serious infringement of trademark is alleged along with the substandard quality thereof. All these matters are most likely to adversely affect the goodwill of the Pepsi Cola Company which is always considered to be irreparable. Taking all the ingredients for the issuance of a temporary injunction we believe at this stage that the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted and hence the appellant has no prima facie case. The irreparable loss in case of grant of injunction, in the circumstances, would be that of the Company and not the Bottlers'. While parting with this aspect of the case, we may remark that, so far as the trademark is concerned, the Bottler has neither claimed any interest therein nor could it be so claimed in view of the express provisions of the contract.
Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant claimed that the ad interim injunction, in the instant case is continuing for a long time since, 1999 and that it would not be in the interest of justice if the same is withdrawn now at this stage. This, in our view is a novel argument. When once the High Court had refused injunction, the case should either have been heard by this Court at the most earliest or ad interim injunction should have been made conditional to early hearing. The injunction was originally granted with direction that the case be heard at the earliest possible. In view of the important nature of the case, the magnitude of the stakes and the quantum of finances involved the continuation of ad interim injunction for such a long time, in the circumstances, was rather sad. The appellant should better be not allowed to benefit from a situation so created. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly argued in rebuttal that this contract was created in the gear 1993 and was terminated in the year 1998 but still, under the force of an ad interim injunction, the appellant is in complete enjoyment of the business not sanctioned and desired by the Pepsi Cola Company.",M.B.A/ B 13/S Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 in a different city.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

Messrs DHL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LTD.: In the matter of
 


 

 


","File No.66/REG/COMP/DHL/CCP/2011, decided on 21st December, 2012.
 ",,,Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the 'Complainant') filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission') against the Respondents. In the complaint it was alleged that the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's stylized and artistically created logo/trademark without the Complainant's permission or authorization or consent. The Commission initiated an enquiry pursuant to section 37(2) of the Act.  with a different defendant.,"In view of the submissions made before us in the subject proceedings, following issues need deliberation:--
 
(i) whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
 
(ii) whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
 
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act,
 
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10, and
 
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
 
","The Respondents of the first category i.e. Mr. Rehan (Respondent No. 1) and ICS Courier (Respondent No. 2) were forthcoming in their conduct as discussed in Paras (36) and (37). Therefore, taking a lenient view, we are not imposing any penalty on both the Respondents; however, they are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in future, which shall otherwise entail serious consequences under the Act.
The Respondent belonging to the second category, i.e. Mr. Uzair, has also provided the documents substantiating that in fact the couriers booked by him were passed on to the Complainant and were eventually sent through the Complainant. He has also provided the details of many other undertakings using the trademark of the Complainant. Although the Respondent has assured the Commission future compliance, it is important that at least some penalty be imposed keeping in view that his practices were misleading and deceptive in terms of section 10. Particularly, the fact that he even represented himself affiliated with the Complainant by using the Complainant's trademark on his visiting card cannot be overlooked being a serious breach. Also, he did not place anything on record to demonstrate that he has discontinued such practices, after the issuance of the show cause notice. Keeping the above in view coupled with his assurance, we are restricting the penalty to Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five hundred Thousand Only).
The Respondents, namely Mr. Asif Iqbal (Respondent No. 4) and Mr. Malik M. Pervaiz Respondent No. 5) have failed in substantiating their stance and have not even demonstrated their good faith through their conduct. The contravention of section 10(1) of the Act stands established in terms of what has already been discussed above. However, we are of the view that the necessary deterrent effect would be achieved and the interests of justice served even if a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only) is imposed.
Similarly, Mr. Nauman Anwer Butt (Respondent No. 6) and Raja Asir Munir (Respondent No. 7), are doing the business in their own names i.e. DHIL and DHS respectively, yet using a logo which is deceptively similar to the Complainant's trademark for which no plausible justification has been placed forward. Based on the principles laid down by the courts in cases of 'passing off' similarity in colour, scheme, get-up, overall similarity and the broad salient features by which an ordinary illiterate customer would be misled for taking product manufactured or services rendered by defendant as that of plaintiff are the relevant factors for such determination. In our considered view in the present case, taking these factors into account we find the Respondents' marks misleading and deceptive and capable of being taken as marks of the Complainant by an ordinary consumer. On comparison these marks bear such resemblance which is likely to cause confusion and deception. It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents. While these Respondents are primarily using their own business names, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 is not relevant. Nonetheless, in the given facts and circumstances, it is in the interest of justice to deter such practices and these Respondents are also held liable to pay a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only).
The Respondents are hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behavior in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to discontinue the use of trademark of the Complainant with immediate effect and not to use it in future without due authorization. The Respondents are also directed to file within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Order, the commitments with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene provisions of section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter, along with the penalty.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondents shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.500,000 (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
 At the end, we cannot ignore the fact that during the proceedings, details of other undertakings along with the images were provided by Mr. Uzair. The Registrar is directed to forward this concern to the OFT department of this Commission for further scrutiny and independent inquiry, if deemed necessary, in terms of section 37 of the Act.
Accordingly, the Show Cause Notices Nos. 26 to 32 of 2012 issued to the Respondents are hereby disposed of in terms of this Order.
","The complaint is filed by Company Secretary Mr. Muhammad Hanif Idrees, with the Complainant's seal and supported by Board Resolution No.12 of 2011, authorizing him and CEO Mr. Sarfaraz Siddiqui to file legal documents regarding the misuse of the DHL trademark.

The complaint is valid, containing the signature of the authorized representative and supported by a power of attorney signed by Mr. Idrees.

The objection that the complaint is not filed by an authorized representative has no merit, as proven by the resolution and signatures provided. The burden of proof that such power did not exist lies on the defendant, who failed to provide contrary evidence.

Some Respondents denied the authenticity of the images in the enquiry report and claimed to have stopped using the DHL trademark. However, these images were verified by an enquiry officer, and Respondents failed to provide rebuttal evidence within the given time.

Respondent Mr. Butt claimed the Complainant encouraged using its trademark, but provided no evidence to substantiate this.

Respondent Mr. Asif Iqbal objected to the complaint, stating it mentioned ""Asir Iqbal,"" who does not work at the site. However, evidence showed ""Asir Iqbal"" was a typographic mistake, and the complaint was indeed against Mr. Asif Iqbal.

The Respondents claimed ignorance of the Competition Act and lack of intent to deceive. However, the Complainant's trademark and logo are globally recognized, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

The essential function of a trademark is to guarantee the origin of goods or services to the consumer, distinguishing them from others. The use of similar logos by the Respondents aimed to capitalize on the Complainant's goodwill, misleading consumers.

The Complainant's trademark is registered in Pakistan and over 220 countries, representing swiftness and speed.

Fraudulent use of the trademark involves misrepresentation to deceive consumers for an advantage, which the Respondents knew or should have known was unauthorized.

The conduct of the Respondents violates section 10(1) of the Act, with varying penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and the conduct of the Respondents.

Respondents Mr. Rehan and ICS Courier, who discontinued using the trademark promptly, are not penalized but are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in the future.

This challenge is based on the grounds that the Plaintiff has not disclosed any valid cause of action against the Defendant, that factual and legal inaccuracies exist in the Plaintiff’s case, and that pertinent information was withheld to sway the Tribunal. The Defendant asserts prior use of the trademark since 2007-2008 and an attempted registration in 2009, which was abandoned due to lack of legal expertise. with a different defendant.","The main issue revolves around whether the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 should be vacated. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff lacks a prima facie case, the balance of convenience does not favor the Plaintiff, and there is no likelihood of irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. The Defendant also asserts prior use and registration attempts for the trademark.","The Tribunal finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated a case for the continuance of the interim injunction. It highlights that owning a well-known mark does not absolve the Plaintiff from proving all necessary elements for injunctive relief. Consequently, the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 is vacated, and the suit is ordered to proceed without the injunction in place.","The Tribunal’s reasoning includes an evaluation of whether all three essential criteria for granting an injunction—prima facie case, balance of convenience, and likelihood of irreparable damage—are met. It reviews the legal standards for granting injunctions, particularly focusing on the principle of ""Dilution"" and whether the Plaintiff’s mark qualifies as a well-known mark under the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001.

The Complaints highlight the fact that Respondents are unresponsive to the SCN violating the law and undermining the writ of the Commission. As the Order will take its due course and considerable time. Hence, to prevent the ongoing infringements and deceptive marketing practices the Commission must restrain the Respondents.

It also alleged copying of its trademark term ""Combo Wings"" by Rahim Foods for one of the products, that is, the chicken wings. Two officers of the Commission, under the delegated powers, conducted an enquiry into the matter complained of. After collecting and considering the respective evidence of the parties, the enquiry officers submitted their report confirming the allegations and proposing the initiation of proceedings against Rahim Foods under Section 30 of the Act. with contradictory witness statements.","(A) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging is misleadingly similar to that of the Complainant's K&N Packing and if so, whether such confusing resemblance is deceptive and amounts to ""fraudulent use of another's ..product labelling or packaging"" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(B) Whether the use of the term/mark 'Combo Wings' by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], in the absence of authorization from the Complainant [K&N's Foods], amounts to """"fraudulent use of another's trademark..."" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(C) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging and/or use of the mark 'Combo Wings' amount to the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interest"" of the Complainant [K&N's Foods] within the meaning andPLD
 scope of Section 10(2)(a) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.","Pursuant to its findings on the said issues, the Commission imposed the following penalties on Rahim Foods for contravention of the provisions of section 10, under section 38 of the Act:
i. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
ii. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
In the exercise of its powers under section 31(c) of the Act, the Commission further directed Rahim Foods to cease the use of the contentious copycat packaging for its frozen and processed meat products and to ensure that the products were repackaged in a manner that was distinct in its overall layout so as to be easily distinguishable from that of the K&N's Foods products.
","the Commission observed that as the trademark ""Combo Wings"" had not been registered at the time of lodging of the complaint by K&N's Foods, its use by Rahim Foods did not constitute a contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act, but decided this issue in affirmative with the following observations:
However, the use of the term ""Combo Wings"" by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], when seen in conjunction with the overall layout and design of the copied and duplicated K&N Packaging, demonstrates the Respondent's intention to pass off its products as those of the Complainant [K&N's Foods]. To such extent only, and as part of its overall scheme of deception, the use of the term in question falls within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, as fraudulent use of another's product labelling.
The Commission and the Tribunal both have also concurred on the point that the above facts fall within the prohibition of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(d) though they have differed on the applicability of Section 10(2)(a) of the Act. They have also expressed divergent views on the requirement of registration of a trademark to attract the provisions of Section 10(2)(d) for ""fraudulent use of another's trademark"".",The appeal filed by the Commission in the present case against the decision of the Tribunal setting aside partially its quasi-judicial order is therefore not maintainable.,Dismissed

","File No.66/REG/COMP/DHL/CCP/2011, decided on 21st December, 2012.
 ",,,Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the 'Complainant') filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission') against the Respondents. In the complaint it was alleged that the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's stylized and artistically created logo/trademark without the Complainant's permission or authorization or consent. The Commission initiated an enquiry pursuant to section 37(2) of the Act.  with new technological evidence.,"In view of the submissions made before us in the subject proceedings, following issues need deliberation:--
 
(i) whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
 
(ii) whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
 
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act,
 
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10, and
 
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
 
","The Respondents of the first category i.e. Mr. Rehan (Respondent No. 1) and ICS Courier (Respondent No. 2) were forthcoming in their conduct as discussed in Paras (36) and (37). Therefore, taking a lenient view, we are not imposing any penalty on both the Respondents; however, they are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in future, which shall otherwise entail serious consequences under the Act.
The Respondent belonging to the second category, i.e. Mr. Uzair, has also provided the documents substantiating that in fact the couriers booked by him were passed on to the Complainant and were eventually sent through the Complainant. He has also provided the details of many other undertakings using the trademark of the Complainant. Although the Respondent has assured the Commission future compliance, it is important that at least some penalty be imposed keeping in view that his practices were misleading and deceptive in terms of section 10. Particularly, the fact that he even represented himself affiliated with the Complainant by using the Complainant's trademark on his visiting card cannot be overlooked being a serious breach. Also, he did not place anything on record to demonstrate that he has discontinued such practices, after the issuance of the show cause notice. Keeping the above in view coupled with his assurance, we are restricting the penalty to Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five hundred Thousand Only).
The Respondents, namely Mr. Asif Iqbal (Respondent No. 4) and Mr. Malik M. Pervaiz Respondent No. 5) have failed in substantiating their stance and have not even demonstrated their good faith through their conduct. The contravention of section 10(1) of the Act stands established in terms of what has already been discussed above. However, we are of the view that the necessary deterrent effect would be achieved and the interests of justice served even if a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only) is imposed.
Similarly, Mr. Nauman Anwer Butt (Respondent No. 6) and Raja Asir Munir (Respondent No. 7), are doing the business in their own names i.e. DHIL and DHS respectively, yet using a logo which is deceptively similar to the Complainant's trademark for which no plausible justification has been placed forward. Based on the principles laid down by the courts in cases of 'passing off' similarity in colour, scheme, get-up, overall similarity and the broad salient features by which an ordinary illiterate customer would be misled for taking product manufactured or services rendered by defendant as that of plaintiff are the relevant factors for such determination. In our considered view in the present case, taking these factors into account we find the Respondents' marks misleading and deceptive and capable of being taken as marks of the Complainant by an ordinary consumer. On comparison these marks bear such resemblance which is likely to cause confusion and deception. It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents. While these Respondents are primarily using their own business names, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 is not relevant. Nonetheless, in the given facts and circumstances, it is in the interest of justice to deter such practices and these Respondents are also held liable to pay a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only).
The Respondents are hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behavior in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to discontinue the use of trademark of the Complainant with immediate effect and not to use it in future without due authorization. The Respondents are also directed to file within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Order, the commitments with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene provisions of section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter, along with the penalty.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondents shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.500,000 (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
 At the end, we cannot ignore the fact that during the proceedings, details of other undertakings along with the images were provided by Mr. Uzair. The Registrar is directed to forward this concern to the OFT department of this Commission for further scrutiny and independent inquiry, if deemed necessary, in terms of section 37 of the Act.
Accordingly, the Show Cause Notices Nos. 26 to 32 of 2012 issued to the Respondents are hereby disposed of in terms of this Order.
","The complaint is filed by Company Secretary Mr. Muhammad Hanif Idrees, with the Complainant's seal and supported by Board Resolution No.12 of 2011, authorizing him and CEO Mr. Sarfaraz Siddiqui to file legal documents regarding the misuse of the DHL trademark.

The complaint is valid, containing the signature of the authorized representative and supported by a power of attorney signed by Mr. Idrees.

The objection that the complaint is not filed by an authorized representative has no merit, as proven by the resolution and signatures provided. The burden of proof that such power did not exist lies on the defendant, who failed to provide contrary evidence.

Some Respondents denied the authenticity of the images in the enquiry report and claimed to have stopped using the DHL trademark. However, these images were verified by an enquiry officer, and Respondents failed to provide rebuttal evidence within the given time.

Respondent Mr. Butt claimed the Complainant encouraged using its trademark, but provided no evidence to substantiate this.

Respondent Mr. Asif Iqbal objected to the complaint, stating it mentioned ""Asir Iqbal,"" who does not work at the site. However, evidence showed ""Asir Iqbal"" was a typographic mistake, and the complaint was indeed against Mr. Asif Iqbal.

The Respondents claimed ignorance of the Competition Act and lack of intent to deceive. However, the Complainant's trademark and logo are globally recognized, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

The essential function of a trademark is to guarantee the origin of goods or services to the consumer, distinguishing them from others. The use of similar logos by the Respondents aimed to capitalize on the Complainant's goodwill, misleading consumers.

The Complainant's trademark is registered in Pakistan and over 220 countries, representing swiftness and speed.

Fraudulent use of the trademark involves misrepresentation to deceive consumers for an advantage, which the Respondents knew or should have known was unauthorized.

The conduct of the Respondents violates section 10(1) of the Act, with varying penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and the conduct of the Respondents.

Respondents Mr. Rehan and ICS Courier, who discontinued using the trademark promptly, are not penalized but are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in the future.

REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS, TRADE MARK REGISTRY and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Petitions Nos.2066 to 2068 of 2013, decided on 20th January, 2015.
 ",,,"Facts in brief, appear to be that Messrs International Foodstuff Company of UAE, (hereinafter abbreviated as IFFCO) the respondent No.2 herein, through Application No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997 applied for the registration of Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" for the goods in Class 29, which inter alia included ""edible oils, and fat; ghee; margarine"". Application inviting opposition for the said trade mark was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-2-2003 published on 14-6-2003, to which the petitioner filed Opposition No. 481 of 2003.

IFFCO, through yet another Application No. 189056 dated 1-8-2005, applied for the registration of trade mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-8-2005, published on 21-8-2005 to which also the petitioner filed opposition No.835/2006.

Petitioner adopted for itself Trade Mark styled as ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"", for the goods in Class 29 and applied for its registration through Application No. 179894, dated 24-8-2002, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-1-2005, published on 11-11-2005, registration of which was challenged by the respondent No.2 through opposition No.01/2006 on the strength of their earlier Application for registration No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997.

All the Applications for the Registration of the competing mark and oppositions thereto, filed by the rival claimants under section 14(1) of the Act, 1940 were taken up, heard and decided by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks, through common order dated 29-9-2009. The Registrar of Trade Marks, in consideration of facts that the IFFCO through evidence has established to the satisfaction of Registrar that they are the originator, proponent and prior user of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"", which mark is not only registered in various jurisdictions but is also used in Middle Eastern and various other countries since 1990. In Pakistan, they started import of its goods (Oil and Ghee) under said brand name or Trademark since 1996, which was supplemented by various invoices evidencing import and use into Pakistan ever since, whereas, the petitioner adopted the competing mark and applied for its registration on 24-8-2002, after more than a decade of its adoption by the IFFCO. Consequently, both the Applications for the Registration of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, made by the IFFCO and their opposition to the Registration of the Trade Mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner were allowed and the Application for registration of impugned mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner and their Opposition Applications were also dismissed. with an additional plaintiff.","Learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner contended that both the marks are quite distinct. It was argued that thorough search was made in the Trade Marks Registry, and as per search report dated 23-10-2002 it was revealed that registered mark is ""nil"" and two applications in class 29 were pending for different products, and in market search, according to learned counsel for the petitioner, similar products were not available, therefore, bona fide and in good faith petitioner had adopted the mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" for Banaspati Ghee, Cooking Oil, Edible Oil, and Palm Oil.
Contentions of the learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner are not substantiated from the record. The official search report (Memorandum) dated 23-10-2002 discloses that IFTCO's Application No.140853 for the trade mark HAYAT, was already pending in class 29 for ""Meat, fish, country and games; meat extracts, preserved dried and cooked fruits and vegetables; jellies; jam; fruit sauces; eggs, milk product; edible oils and fats; ghee; margarine; being goods included in class 29"" (page 41 in CPLA in 2067/13) (emphasis supplied), therefore, it cannot be urged that the petitioners were not aware of the adoption and use of Trademark 'HAYAT' by IFFCO.","No other grounds were urged. For what has been discussed above, order dated 29-9-2009 passed by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks and the impugned order dated 12-9-2013 passed by High Court in appeals, could not be interfered with. Consequently, the listed Civil Petitions are dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.","It may be observed that section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 forbids registration of trade mark and or a part of the trade mark that may comprise of or embraces, any scandalous design or any matter the use of which would by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice (emphasis added). Likewise section 10(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, puts a clog on the registration of trade mark in respect of any goods and or description of goods which is identical with a trade mark belonging to a different proprietor and either already registered in any of the acceding state in respect of same goods or descriptions of goods or ""which so nearly resembled such trade mark as to be likely deceive or cause confusion"". 
As regards contention of learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner that both the marks are quite distinct and dissimilar and there is no likelihood of confusion and or deception. According to him, use of prefix FAROOQ'S, the trading name of the petitioner to the word 'Hayat', distinguishes petitioners good from that of IFFCO. It may be observed that merely adding a prefix and or suffix to already existing trademark will not save the petitioner from the clutches of section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1940, which prohibits registration of a trade mark or a part of trade mark, which is ""likely to deceive or cause confusion"". Trade Marks Act, 1940 (as succeeded by Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, which came into force on 12-4-2004 per S.R.O. No.212(I)/2004) not only protect consumers, but also traders who adopt a particular trademark, which distinguishes their goods, products and services from other competing traders, producers and service providers. The Court also took note of the fact that many trade marks were already registered with prefix ""SUN"" This court allowed respondent the use of LIGHT within certain territorial bound and by adding its trade name SULTAN before LIGHT. Case of Ekhlas Ahmed 1980 SCMR 625, is of no help to the petitioner rather goes against the Petitioner. In the cited case, this Court itself examined the competing mark by examining the copy of carton of ""VEST"" applied for registration, with that of the trade mark ""VEET"" of the foreign based company and found visual and phonetic similarity between both the mark and declined to interfere in the finding recorded by High Court.
In instant case adoption of dominant feature being ""HAYAT"" is not only strikingly similar but is identical as noted above, merely adding prefix of ""FAROOQ'S"" in inconspicuous manner to the dominant or striking feature of the existing trademark HAYAT is of no consequence. The prefix ""FAROOQ'S"" as used by the petitioner in instant case does not eclipse, overshadows or obscures the dominating mark HAYAT in a way that may distinguish his goods with that of the goods of the IFFCO.
It is not very uncommon that unscrupulous traders or the manufacturers tend to confuse and or mislead consumers of goods of known or popular brands by taking shield and protection under various other laws governing intellectual property rights namely Patent, Merchandise, Designs, Trade Marks and or Copy Rights. There is growing tendency of using such terms interchangeably or treating such terms synonymously. It may be observed that there may be some similarities and overlapping in intent and purport of such rights, but rights of a proprietor/owner in each namely trademark, merchandise mark, Patent and Design and or Copyrights govern different category of intellectual properties and recognize host of different and special rights, obligations and remedies in their respective domain. There is growing tendency of misappropriating rights in one type of intellectual property by seeking protection under different statute governing altogether different intellectual property. Most abused are rights in trade marks under the garb of copyrights, later aims to protect original works of art or creative articulation may be of a trade mark in any tangible medium of expression, whereas, trademarks is associated with the goods for the purpose of indicating or so to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the rights, either as a proprietor or as registered user, to use or apply the trade mark on his goods. Trade Marks Act, 1940 protects the proprietor to use the trademark on his goods, and prevent others competitors from using and applying identical and or confusingly similar trade mark on their goods of similar class or description. There is no prohibition under the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for the competitors/traders from making, producing or marketing same or similar goods, only restriction placed is on the use and or adoption of same or deceptively and or confusingly similar trade mark. A trader may make or market or sell same or similar category of goods falling in same class but under different brand name or trade mark that clearly distinguishes its goods from same category or class of goods. Petitioner may continue to manufacture, produce and market its competing and similar goods under class 29, but under different brand name or trade mark.
It may be noted that Practice of using copyright as a substitute for the trademark was deprecated and defence of the infringer resting on registration of copyright was sternly rejected in large number of cases including cases reported as Tapal Tea (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Co. (2002 CLD 1113), Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), Messrs ADT Services AG v. ADT Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (2005 CLD 1546), Muhammad Wahid v. Adnan Memon (2010 CLD 450). In most of the reported cases, the Courts have rightly desired amendments to protect valuable rights and obligations in intellectual property under various statutes regulating such rights and obligation and arrest, misuse and abuse of such statute to the determent of honest and truthful traders and entrepreneurs.",MWA/F-8/SC Petition dismissed.,Dismissed.

FAMOUS BRANDS (PVT.) LIMITED---Defendant

","Suit No. 2040 of 2017, decided on 24th July, 2018.","16th, 29th March, 19th April and 10th May, 2018.","MUHAMMAD JUNAID GHAFFAR, J.","All three listed applications are being dealt with and decided through this common order. Application at serial Nos. 1 and 2 have been filed on behalf of the Defendant under Order VII, Rules 10 and 11, Civil Procedure Code (""C.P.C.""), whereas, application at serial No. 3 is under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. filed on behalf of the Plaintiff seeking an injunction against the Defendant.

This is a Suit for Declaration, Permanent Injunction and Damages being sought against the Defendant for allegedly infringing their trademark as well as passing-off the same by selling such goods as a licensed vendor under the name and style of Plaintiff's trademark. This Suit has been filed on behalf of two Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff No.1 is a company governed and registered under the laws of Luxembourg, whereas, Plaintiff No.2 is a company incorporated under the laws of United Arab Emirates. It is claimed that Plaintiffs jointly own and are authorized to the exclusive use of the registered trademarks of their companies under the name and style of ""SAMSONITE"" Group for trademarks which includes but are not limited to, 'SAMSONITE' 'AMERICAN TOURISTER' and 'HIGH SIERRA' (relevant for the present purposes), in addition to various other trademarks as well. It is their claim that Samsonite brands are known as the world's largest and most recognizable brands of luggage, bags and other related items.

 under different legal circumstances.",I have heard both the learned Counsel and perused the record. Facts have been briefly stated hereinabove and it appears that the Plaintiffs claim and hold Intellectual Property Rights of various trademarks such as 'SAMSONITE' 'AMERICAN TOURISTER' and 'HIGH SIERRA' which are relevant for the present dispute. The Plaintiff No. 1 is presently the company which owns the entire business of the Samsonite group including various trademarks worldwide. To that effect trademark registration certificates of various brands in International Jurisdiction under Class 18 and 35 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services have been placed on record and do not appear to be in dispute. ,"Insofar as the applicability of section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is concerned, it provides that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if such person uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered. The primary consideration provided therein is that the Trademark of which infringement is being alleged, must necessarily be ""registered"". And in case it is not registered, then at least claim of infringement is not maintainable, but a claim of passing-off can always be pressed upon, subject to the parameters prescribed for entertaining such claim. Here there are several trademarks in question and out of such only one of the said trademarks is registered and i.e. ""American Tourister Word"" in class 18 against application No. 81872. The other marks in question as mentioned in Para 6 above are either pending or publication has been made in the Trade Mark Journal; but admittedly they are not registered as yet. Hence, in the given circumstances, it is only one trademark as above for which infringement could be pressed upon in terms of the Ordinance. For rest of the marks, at the most, it is only a case of passing-off which could be pressed upon. As to sections 85 and 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, admittedly Pakistan is a signatory to the Paris Convention and TRIPs for the protection of industrial property as revised and amended from time to time and in view of such signing of the treaty the legislature has enacted section 86 giving protection to well-known trademarks. Subsection (2) thereof provides that the Tribunal (Court) while determining whether a trade mark is well-known, without having to require registration or actual use in the form of sale of goods or services under the trade mark in Pakistan, shall consider the factors provided therein as a relevant criteria for establishing the well-known status of the trade mark in question. It empowers the Court to make determination without requiring registration and or use of such mark in Pakistan and could be either in relation to goods or services, as the case may be. Learned Counsel for the Defendant while controverting the claim of the plaintiffs in respect of applicability of Section 86 ibid had made a submission that this is only relevant for the purposes of deciding an application for registration of a trademark by the Registrar and cannot be considered in a claim of injunction. However, with respect I am unable to agree with such stance. The law discussed hereinabove is clear in terms and subsection (2) of section 86 ibid, provides that it is not necessary that for having protection of this nature a mark must necessarily be registered; and subsection (3) further provides that the owner of a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention as a well-known mark, shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Pakistan of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical or deceptively similar to the well-known trade mark. In fact it the other way round; and has been mandated to give protection to well-known marks, who are not even registered or in use in Pakistan; but are well known and registered worldwide. Though not necessarily required in view of no defence to the fact that Samsonite is a mark of world recognition and is in use in Pakistan on behalf of the plaintiffs, as well as claim of registration going on without opposition; it may be observed, that it is not in dispute with a serious degree of contention that Samsonite Corporation was established in the year 1910 and perhaps is the world's largest travel luggage company. 
After having perused the record before me and in the light of the above information and for the fact that nothing has been put in defence as to the claim of the plaintiffs that their marks are well-known, except that this protection only applies while seeking registration of a trademark (which I have already disagreed with), here in this case the three trademarks of the Plaintiffs in question including the trademark Samsonite in my view falls within well-known marks as defined under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance read with the definition so provided in the Paris Convention. I have already discussed hereinabove as to what constitutes a well-known mark under the Paris Convention to which Pakistan is already a signatory, whereas, corresponding legislation in the form of sections 85 and 86 in the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, is already in place. Therefore, in this situation when the law itself waives the condition of being registered as against requirement of section 40 ibid, denying a Trade Mark holder, the benefit of such protection of infringement/injunction would be against the law. It is a matter of legal right and must not be denied ordinarily. In fact nothing has been pleaded on behalf of the Defendant to the effect that the trademarks in question including Samsonite is not a well-known mark; therefore, in the given facts and circumstances the Plaintiffs case for a restraining order through an injunctive relief merits consideration under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 notwithstanding the fact that except one; other trademarks are not yet registered.

In these circumstances, the applications at serial Nos. 1 and 2 are dismissed whereas, the application at serial No. 3 is allowed in the above terms.

","Before proceeding further on merits of the injunction application, firstly I would like to deal with the two applications of the Defendant under Order VII, Rules 10 and 11, C.P.C. Both these applications have been filed simultaneously seeking return and or rejection of the Plaint. The precise ground taken in the application under Order VII, Rule 10, C.P.C. is to the effect that the relationship and or terms and conditions between the parties were being handled at Lahore, whereas, the head office of the Defendant is also in Lahore, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction. It has been further stated that various litigations are already pending in the Lahore Jurisdiction and therefore, on this ground also this Court has no jurisdiction. However, I may observe that Defendant is admittedly operating an office in Karachi as well as retail shops within Karachi and the present dispute and cause of action so stated on behalf of the Plaintiffs is to the effect that after termination of the relationship, the Defendant is still using and pretending to be an authorized reseller by displaying the logo of Samsonite on the signboards in and outside its shops. Hence, in view of such position, I am of the view that this is a separate and independent cause of action and the alleged cause falls within the jurisdiction of this Court; hence, the plaint cannot be returned merely on this ground. 
Insofar as the injunction application bearing C.M.A. No.12935/2017 is concerned, the Plaintiff's case primarily is that after termination of the relationship with the Defendant, whereby, the Defendant was permitted to act as a distributor and reseller, the Defendant is no more authorized to sell goods bearing the Plaintiffs trademarks. The ground for such prayer is based on the premise that firstly, the trademarks in question belonging to the Plaintiffs are well known marks as defined in the Paris Convention as well as under sections 85 and 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. Secondly, the contention is that certain marks are already registered and are protected under section 40 of the Ordinance ibid, whereas, the remaining marks have already been applied for and in some cases the assignment deeds are pending, but notwithstanding the pendency of the assignment deeds, these marks belong to the Plaintiffs and the act of Defendant tantamount to infringement as defined under section 40 of the Ordinance, 2001. It is also the case of the Plaintiff's that such act of the Defendant also amounts to passing-off the Plaintiffs goods. For the purposes of injunction, it is the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant is using the ""Samsonite"" signage on its retail shops. 
The need to protect well-known marks was discussed amongst member countries of the Paris Convention in 1920, which resulted in the aforesaid Article. This Article places all member states under obligation either to reject/cancel the registration, or prohibit the use, of trademarks which are confusingly similar to a well-known mark. This protection was originally available only for trademarks relating to goods, not services. However, countries belonging to Paris Convention were not prevented from extending the protection to services. This Article at times was noted and considered to be extremely insufficient, and since 1995 World Intellectual Property Organization (""WIPO"") had been advocating for a separate treaty for its protection in more clear terms. Thereafter in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (more commonly known as ""TRIPS-agreement""), Article 6 of the Paris Convention has been improved to a great extent, by incorporating Article 16 in the following terms;

Well-known trademarks are to be protected for services as well as products. The protection extends beyond just similarity to situations where use of the trademark would indicate a connection between the product/service and the owner of the well-known trademark, and could cause detriment to the trademark owner.

Account must be taken of knowledge of the relevant sector of the public i.e. the mark needs to be famous in relation to the goods and services where its use is likely to cause confusion.

Versus
REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents
","M.A. No. 11 of 2006, decided on 11th November, 2019.","27th May, 2019.","SYED HASAN AZHAR RIZVI, J.","The brief facts of this case are that the appellant is a private limited company incorporated in Pakistan. The dispute involves ownership rights of trademark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan in respect to Class 16 of the international classification of goods. The parent organization of the appellant, Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO), introduced public survey and public opinions research in Pakistan. PIPO and its affiliate organization Gallup Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited and the appellant are the only members of Gallup International Association in Pakistan and are the exclusive users of trade mark GALLUP in Pakistan till to date. In 1981, PIPO became the exclusive Associate Member of Gallup International in Pakistan. In 1984, PIPO became the exclusive full member of Gallup International in Pakistan and PIPO and its affiliates have been consistently using the trademark GALLUP and Gallup Pakistan together with Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion since at least 1981. Gallup Pakistan has been existing for nearly forty years and has been the exclusive user of the trade mark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan. The joint names of Gallup Pakistan and Gallup Organization in the International Gallup Directories illustrate that respondent No. 2 never claimed any right for use of name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan nor objected to the use of the said name by the appellant and its affiliates in Pakistan. Respondent No. 2 accepted throughout the right of Gallup Pakistan to use the name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan exclusively. The appellant on 07.5.1994 filed an Application No. 124363 for registration of its trademark ""GALLUP"" in Class 16 and the application was accepted for advertisement. Respondent No. 2 filed Opposition No. 56 of 1999 alleging that it was the proprietor of Trade Mark ""GALLUP"" and also disclosed pendency of its Application No. 129970 dated 02.5.1995 for registration of same mark in same class. Respondent No. 2 has failed to file a single document showing use of the name ""Gallup"" by them in Pakistan. The appellant filed a counter statement to the opposition along with documentary evidence and affidavit supporting such counter statement. Respondent No. 2 never filed any reply or rejoinder to the counter-statement of the appellant. The contents of the appellant's counter statement therefore remain un-rebutted till date. under unusual conditions.","""Who is the proprietor of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan?""
""Whether use of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan by the Appellant would entitle it to secure registration in its name?""
""Whether the adoption of the trademark 'Gallup' by Applicant constitutes honest concurrent user?""","After taking into account evidence about the long history of the GIA, domestic courts in these and many other countries came to recognize that Respondent No. 2 is just a rich American corporation which is trying to unfairly bag the fruits of the labor of independent scholars from all over the world.""
""Therefore, the plea of the appellant that since presently the respondent No.1 is not dealing in 'tea-product' hence registration of its mark 'AHMAD LOAD TEA' shall cause no harm to respondent No.1 is misconceived.""
""As regard another plea of the appellant that since respondent No.1 has not objected/opposed to grant of mark 'AHMED' in class-30 to other entity 'AHMED TEA COMPANY, PESHAWAR' hence respondent No.1 cannot object / oppose the application of the appellant, it would suffice to say that such plea alone cannot prevail over the rights, created by section 29(4) of the Ordinance to every such application nor legally mere negligence in making proper opposition to some earlier application can be a ground to deprive the authorized user from those rights and privileges which are the creation of the law itself.""","Mr. Ijaz Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the impugned order has been passed without taking into consideration the fact that the appellant is the exclusive user of trademark ""Gallup"" in Pakistan, which is established by admitted documents. He has further argued that it is an established fact that the name of the appellant or its parent organization has appeared several times in Gallup International Directories along with and to the knowledge of respondent No.2. He has also argued that respondent No.2's use of this trademark anywhere else in the world is irrelevant as respondent No.2 has failed to prove any work carried out by them in Pakistan. He has urged that the entire project of Gallup Pakistan was started by Dr. Ijaz Shafi Gilani upon encouragement of Dr. Gallup since 1978. He has also urged that Dr. Gallup and scholars from their respective countries established ""The International Association of Public Opinions Institutes"" which was later converted into ""Gallup International Research Institutes and thereafter Gallup International Association was incorporated, which took over the business of Gallup International Research Institutes and Gallup International only makes one member in every country, these members also had the right to use the name ""Gallup"" in Dr. Gallup's own life time as well as afterwards. He has argued that the Appellant is honest, concurrent user in terms of international usage and reputation of the trademark ""Gallup"".
Learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the impugned order is a non-speaking order and does not contain any reasoning at all for arriving at the conclusion. It merely reproduces the contention of the parties and nothing more as the only discussion made by the Registrar does not contain any reasoning and completely ignores the evidence produced by the appellant. He has urged that Registrar has failed to mention a single document filed by the appellant. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed by completely ignoring the relevant facts and evidence. In this regard he made reference to Section 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 clearly states that disputed issues relating to title of a trademark cannot be decided without proper evidence.",MH/G-45/Sindh Appeal allowed.,Allowed

SHEZAN SERVICES LIMITED (Now known as SHEZAN SERVICES (PRIVATE) LIMITED---Appellant
Versus
SHEZAN BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003, decided on 19th May, 2018.","25th April and 4th May, 2018.","Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, J","This Misc. Appeal under section 76 of Trademarks Act, 1940 impugns an order of the Registrar of Trademarks passed in dealing with Opposition No.218/2001 while considering the application of the respondent, registered as No.100857/29. The order on the opposition releases the application from such opposition and proceeded it for registration subject to the conditions that the word ""Shezan"" shall always be used in collaboration with either Lahore Continental, Lahore Oriental or Lahore Bakery and will always be used within the territory of Lahore Division.
2. It is the time of the appellant that they entered into the agreement with one Shezan Lahore, which was a partnership firm at the relevant time having its partners as Ch. Riazuddin and Rao Muhammad Usman, which then, with the passage of time, has taken shape of Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited, respondent No. 1 herein. Thus, Shezan Lahore in fact is a predecessor in right of the respondent Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited.
3. It is the case of the appellant that the agreement dated 19.02.1975 with their predecessor and the predecessor of respondent No.1 was in respect of two restaurants i.e. Shezan Continental at 46-Dingah Singh Building, and Shezan Oriental, 7-Dayal Singh Mansions, both at Shahrah-e-Qaid-e-Azam Lahore and a bakery to serve the above two restaurants for sale of their product. Appellant have attempted to argue that in terms of aforesaid agreement they have agreed to sell and the respondent No.1 has agreed to buy the goodwill of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery, which does not include the sale of word ""Shezan"" as trademark, either with or without logo.
 in a different city.","Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent cannot take shelter of subsection (2) of section 10 of 'Trademarks Act, 1940 as they were not concurrent user of the trademark in its actual perspective. Learned counsel for the appellant further relied upon Chapter 5 i.e. assignment and transmission of the Trademarks Act, 940 and relied upon section 29, which deals with the assignment and transmission of trademark, whether in connection with the goodwill of the business or not, and went on to argue that these two are different and distinct entities, as understood from the language of section 29, and since word 'Shezan' as trademark was never specifically assigned or transmitted, it could only be presumed that goodwill of the business of two restaurants and bakery, including the rights of trademark, was assigned under the aforesaid agreement. He has further relied upon the judgment of Additional CIT v. Kwality Frozen Foods from Indian jurisdiction of Mumbai Bench in IT Appeal No.5023 (Mum.) of 2001, which is an unreported matter, Noor Muhammad v. Civil Aviation Authority reported in 1987 CLC 393, Seven Up Company v. Deputy Registrar Trademark reported in 1937 MLD 91.
On the other hand learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has relied upon provisions of section 10(2) of Trademarks Act, 1940 and submitted that it is the honest concurrent use since 1975 that enabled the respondent No.1 to file application, referred above; before the Registrar Trademarks which was subjected to the opposition of the appellant and was disposed of in terms of the impugned order. She has attempted to argue that before 1975 the predecessor of the appellant and respondent were partners but without making an attempt to establish such relationship she relied upon the terms of the agreement dated 19.02.1975, which, per learned counsel, is sufficient to claim their concurrent use and entitlement for its registration under the law. In support of her contention, she has relied upon the case of Cluett, Peobody & Co. v. Assistant Registrar Trademark 1991 SCMR 921 which defines the concurrent use of trademark and the case of Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090. She further relied upon the judgment in the case of Levi and Volika of the Chancellery Division 1879 and the case of Crembux Limited of Chancellery Division 1928.
",Upshot of the above discussion is that the appellant has failed to make out a case calling to interfere in the impugned order as passed by the Registrar of Trademark hence the appeal is dismissed.,"The impugned decision concludes in paragraphs 14 and 15 that the respondent is using the trademark Shezan as a result of agreement of 1975 and there appears to be no moral, ethical and legal justification for the opposition of the appellant. It was further observed that the opponent/appellant had himself given the right to use the mark ""for consideration"" and the opposition to register the said mark is not tenable on account of continuous use since 1975 without any action on their part hence respondent No.1 stood qualified for the registration under section 10(2). The Registrar however restricted its use while dismissing the opposition and releasing the application of the respondent for its process of registration to two restaurants i.e. Continental and Oriental and Bakery, all of them situated within the territory of Lahore division.
In order to conclude as to whether along with goodwill the trademark ""Shezan"" was also passed on to respondent, the perusal of the terms of the agreement would be very material. In the first recital of the agreement, the company i.e. appellant stated to be carrying on business of hotel, restaurant and bakery in various towns of Pakistan including Lahore and then these three subject premises were described. In the second recital these three premises were claimed to be on rental and the respondent No.1 was given the obligation to deal with the issue of renewal of such leases. In the fifth recital of second page of the agreement, it is stated that on account of negotiations, the company i.e. appellant's predecessor has agreed to sell and the firm i.e respondent's predecessor has agreed to buy the ""goodwill"" of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery at a price which was acknowledged by the appellant/their predecessor. In term of first recital of the third page it is stated that through a separate negotiation the firm/respondent had purchased from the company/appellant against consideration the machinery and air-conditioning etc.
The covenants of the agreement also provide right to continue the business of these two restaurants and bakery and at such other places where the firm/respondent may deem fit within the territorial limits of Lahore division only under the subject name and style i.e. Shezan. However, it restricts its use in any other manner whatsoever except provided above.
The word ""goodwill"" and ""trademark"" were attempted to be treated as blood relatives. I would go on to penetrate further that in the subject case goodwill of a premises or of a place or of a business would worth nothing in case the subject and the essence of that business is extracted. If for instance a restaurant is being run successfully, it is not only premises or the infrastructure or ambiance that carries the reputation; it is the name and brand that carries the reputation too which is non-extractable part of goodwill and that may contribute towards building of a reputation. If one excludes the name of any good restaurant then it will be left with no other asset except an immovable property. The interpretation of subsection (2) of section 10 of Trademarks Act, 1940, in view of the above, cannot he restricted to a simple concurrent use irrespective of any agreement. Use of trademark under the agreement is not only permissive use but conclusive rights were being delegated and hence the use is concurrent to the use of the inventor. The subject use thus would come within honest concurrent use under the circumstances described in the agreement. It is inconceivable that the appellant would enjoy the consideration of a rental premises if the right of trademark is excluded. Certainly the consideration was for a particular territory i.e. Lahore division which was taken care of by the Registrar.
20. Had it been a case of permissive use only the appellant would have claimed a royalty for continuous use of the word/trademark, which is not the case here. It only advances the case of the respondent that the sale of goodwill includes the sale of trademark subject to its use within the territory defined therein.

","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28 of 2007, 6, 27, 81 of 2008 and 1 of 2009, decided on 25th July, 2018.","25th April, 2018.","KAUSAR SULTANA HUSSAIN, J.","Succinct the case of the appellant is that they filed applications before Registrar Trade Marks in accordance with the provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1940 and the Rules framed in pursuant to such Act, referred as Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963, such application were submitted prior to 12.04.2004 which is the date of coming into force of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, which was though promulgated on 14.04.2001, however in terms of section 1(3), the Ordinance had to take effect from a date to be notified in Official Gazette as reproduced below:-
(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 with a different defendant.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

","Suit No.983 and C.M.A. No.6910 of 2007, decided on 2nd November, 2007.",,,"By this application the plaintiffs has prayed that defendant may be restrained from copying and/or applying the plaintiffs Registered designs namely 11357-D, 12310-D, 12311-D, 12312-D, 12328-D and 12329-D and plaintiff No.2's registered trademark No.187121 dated 19th July, 2003 namely ""BODYCAP"" and from making, importing, selling, hiring, offering to sell or hire or working articles bearing or embodying a design and/or trademark which, is a copy of the said registered designs.
 
The facts 'necessary for disposal of the application are that tilt plaintiff No.1 is the registered proprietor of above mentioned designs registered under Designs Ordinance XLV of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the registered designs) and the fibre canopies manufactured as per these designs are sold by the plaintiffs under the trademark "" BODYCAP"" duly registered in the name of plaintiff No.2. It. is alleged that the defendant is imitating the said designs and. applying the same to the canopies it manufactures, and sells.
 under unusual conditions.","The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submit that the plaintiffs' are the registered proprietors of the designs and trademark and have the exclusive right to use the said designs and trademark and the defendant by using the said designs and trademark violating their exclusive, rights. He further submits that the canopies made by.. the defendant"" are similar to the canopies manufactured by the plaintiff and submits that for claiming infringement of registered designs it is not necessary that the imitation are substantially similar with the registered designs. The learned counsel has referred to the photographs of the registered designs as well as the photographs of the canopies manufactured by the defendant and submits that from looking two canopies it is established that they are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. ","For the above reason the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case in his favour and the balance of convenience is also in their favour and in case the injunction is not granted they will suffer irreparable loss and will be deprived from the benefits of the registered designs.
 
In view of the above the application is allowed as prayed with no order as to costs.

","The plaintiffs by filing the photocopies of the certificates for registration of designs and certificate of Registration of Trademark ""BODYCAP"" established their right to exclusively use the design and trademark. The plaintiff by filing the photographs of the canopies manufactured by it and by the defendant has also established that both are similar to each other and are capable of creating confusion and deception. The defendant by not filing his reply has failed to rebut the above factual controversy.
 
Subsection (2) of section 7 of the Registered Design Ordinance provides that the owner of a registered design shall have right to exclude third parties, not having his consent, from making, selling or working articles or embodying a design which is a copy of the registered design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purpose.
 
The plaintiff No.1 being the Registered Proprietor of the designs mentioned above is entitled to exclusively use the same and defendant without his consent have no right to copy the same.
 
Section 8 of the Ordinance deals with infringement. Subsection (1) of section 8 provides that if any person infringes a registered proprietor's right, the registered proprietor may bring a suit against him for the recovery of damages and for an injunction against the continuation of the infringement. Provided that for the purpose of grant of a temporary injunction, the registered proprietor must show that he has a prima facie case and that his design is valid and that it has been infringed by the defendant.
 
The design of the defendant is almost similar to the registered designs of the plaintiffs and the Registered designs of plaintiff No. 1 are still valid.
 
In the unreported case of Messrs Team Nayyer (Pvt.) Limited v. Kamran Jamal Khan (Suit No.495 of 2007) authored by my learned brother Mushir Alam, J. it was held as under:
 
""After hearing the Federal counsel I have observed that there is apparently strong resemblance on both the canopies of the plaintiff and defendant and minor difference pointed out by the defendant, which are still subject to objection, cannot make much difference to remove the deception in respect to recognition as to whether both canopies are from one designer or not. The Registrar of design is also of the view that canopy of the plaintiff is registered with design No.12310-D while the design applied for by the defendant was refused.""
 
For claiming infringement it is not necessary that the two designs are similar to each other in all respect. Resemblance in two designs are sufficient to establish infringement. In this case the plaintiff prima facie established that the design of the defendant resembled with the registered designs of the plaintiff and is capable of creating confusion and deception.","

","First Appeal from Order No.213 of 2012, decided on 28th September, 2012.",,,"Appellant herein is a public limited company and claims to be the creator, originator, owner and user of trademark ""P"" in stylized form (hereafter stylized ""P"" logo) which it claims to be using since the inception of its business of cement manufacturing, marketing and selling for more than two decades. It claims to have launched a new brand of cement for export to Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics with the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device. It is claimed that cement bags with the said trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device were designed and printed for the appellant first time by a company called Syntronics Limited in May 2010.
The appellant claims to have engaged respondent No.3, a Pakistani company having its office in Peshawar as its distributor and submits that respondent No.3, as a distributor of the appellant, entered into a contract with an Afghan company named Shirkat-ul-Faisal and started exporting cement to Afghanistan under the trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device. It is alleged that after some time relationship between the appellant and respondent No.3 came to an end, whereafter respondent No.3 contracted appellant's competitor, respondent No.1, and started exporting cement to Shirakat-ul-Faisal in Afghanistan under appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device in utter disregard of law and violation of business ethics and with dishonesty and mala fide.
To restrain respondents from using the aforesaid trademark, the appellant filed a suit for infringement coupled with passing off the goods before the learned District Judge, Lahore, along with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. and the learned Additional District Judge granted a restraining order on 24th June, 2011 which was withdrawn through the impugned order dated 29-3-2012. 
The respondents resisted the suit and inter alia challenged the claim of proprietorship of the trademark by the appellant. Certain allegations about concealment of some facts concerning dealership were also raised and it was also asserted that Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited has obtained registration of Two Elephants device in Afghanistan. Strong reliance by the respondents was placed on obtaining trademark registration in Afghanistan by Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited in Afghanistan. with new evidence presented.","Whether the appellant is the prior user and owner of the disputed trademark comprising the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device and whether the respondents' use of the trademark constitutes infringement and passing off.","In the light of the above, this appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned order dated 29-3-2012, is set aside. The respondents are restrained to use the appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device till the final disposal of the suit. It is however noted that the observations made above are tentative in nature and would not influence the decision of the suit on merits after recording of evidence. As valuable rights of parties are involved it is ordered that the trial Court shall decide the suit within six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.","If Do Pheel/Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, a Director of respondent No.3, it seems inconceivable that they would continue to use it with stylized ""P"" logo, as stylized ""P"" logo is admittedly the trademark of appellant. This, prima facie, shows dishonesty on the part of the respondents. In this respect even if, for argument's sake, it is considered that Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, then if, as per respondent's own stance that their dealership was unlawfully cancelled by the appellant, it was their legal, moral and ethical duty to have only taken their alleged Two Elephants device trademark to respondents Nos.1 and 2 (Fecto Cement Limited) to start export with Two Elephants device replacing appellant's stylized ""P"" logo with that of Fecto's own logo. This was apparently not done for obvious reasons that respondents desired to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" logo as a trademark of the appellant by virtue of its use on cement exported to Afghanistan.
There is a further aspect to respondents' prima facie dishonest act and their efforts to deceive the Courts. If Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4 (Mr. S. Mehtab Hussain), a Director of respondent No.3, then it is not understandable why they would allow Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited, which is a separate entity, to register it in its name in Afghanistan and not in the name of the said respondent or respondent No.3. 
As far as Distributorship is concerned it is pertinent to note that respondents in their written statement have admitted the existence of distributorship and have referred to it as well as attached a copy of said letter in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Factual Matrix of the written statement as reproduced below:--

(1) That the plaintiff approached defendant(s) Nos.3 and 4 in order to subscribe to their services as exclusive and sole distributor(s)/dealer(s). The plaintiff, at all material times, represented and assured that defendant No.3 would be engaged to the exclusion of all others. It is submitted that Dho Pheel/(the two elephants) was the brainchild of defendant No.4, who is and was at all material times, the Director of defendant No.3.

(2) That the plaintiff through its General Manager (Marketing and Sales), Mr. Rizwari Butt, confirmed the appointment of defendant No.4 as the authorized Sole Distributor for Afghanistan and CARs (Central Asian Republics) through a letter dated 29-3-2010. A copy of the letter dated 29-3-2010 is placed herewith as Annex-E.

(3) That the albeit it is beyond the scope of the present proceedings, it is nevertheless the case that the plaintiff flagrantly breached the Dealership Agreement, which it had struck with defendant No.3. Consequently, the latter, on the plaintiff's contractual repudiation, was but only impelled to enter into a Dealership Agreement dated 20-4-2011 with defendant No.1 (viz, Fecto Cement Limited). A copy of an email written by defendant No.4 to the General Manager of defendant No.1 substantiating these state of affairs is placed herewith as Annex -F.
The learned trial Court has stated the correct principle that in trademark cases most important factor is who is prior user of trademark. This principle is in particular applicable when none of the contesting parties is armed with a registered trademark. Despite stating the correct principle, in my humble view, the learned trial Judge committed a serious error when he concluded that the plaintiff company (appellant) did not produce any cogent and convincing material in this regard. This apparently reflects that the learned trial Judge did not pay much attention to the pleadings of the parties nor perused the documents available on the record. 
In the present case, there is admittance on the part of the respondents that respondent No.3 has acted as a distributor for the appellant and sold appellant's cement with the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device to Afghanistan. Therefore, there is no denial or challenge that the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device was not first used by the appellant and cement with this trademark was not sold in Afghanistan through respondent No.3 as a distributor of appellant and thus there is no denial that appellant is the prior user of the disputed trademark.
In my humble opinion the distributor's appointment letter and above admitted facts were sufficient to, prima facie, show that appellant was the prior user and prior owner of the Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" trademark for cement. Moreover the respondents have not explained the reason for their choice to use the stylized ""P"" logo along with Two Elephants, when respondent No.1 itself seems to be a well known company, it should have chosen to use its own independent logo and not that of its competitors. It is in particular not appreciable that big business groups resort to copying their competitors trademarks, as, prima facie, seems to be the case here.
In the light of the above, it clearly appears that the appellant has made out a prima facie case in its favour and is likely to suffer irreparable loss if the respondents are not restrained from using the stylized ""P"" logo and the Two Elephants device. I must add here that trademark rights are lifelines of businesses and unauthorized use of owner's trademark by third parties results in un-quantifiable loss and damage to its goodwill and business which is irreparable in nature. Thus the loss that the appellant is likely to suffer as a result of use of appellant's trademark by the respondents cannot be calculated in terms of monetary compensation and would be irreparable in nature. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the appellant. I must also observe that under section 46(2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 all such reliefs by way of damages, injunction, accounts are available to the proprietor of a trademark simultaneously and not as an alternate to each other and just because in addition to interim injunction a plaintiff may claim damages and compensation in a suit relating to trademark rights, interim relief cannot be denied on that ground.

","Suit No. 2223 of 2015 and Judicial Miscellaneous No. 9 of 2016, decided on 13th June, 2017.",,,"This single order will dispose of C.M.A. No.16652/2015 moved by the Plaintiff in Suit No.2223 of 2015, seeking injunction against the Defendant from using the getup and design of Design No.17023-D owned by the Plaintiff, as well as, restraining the Defendant from using trade mark ""ZORRO"" on the ground that the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of trade mark ""ORO"", as well J.M.No.09/2016 filed by the Defendant will also be disposed off, through which cancellation of the Plaintiff's registered design has been sought by the Defendant.
While it is admitted that the Plaintiff owns trade mark ""ORO"" which has been registered by it with the Trade Marks Registry in respect of class 16 goods w.e.f. 22.09.2010, it also has secured registration of the design of pencils (under dispute) as provided under the mechanism laid down by the Registered Designs Ordinance, 2000. An examination of the Design Registration Certificate dated 23.01.2014 shows that the novelty of the design has been claimed to reside in the ornamental pattern as applied to pencils, as fully illustrated in the representation of the design. 
Allegation levelled by the counsel for the Plaintiff are that the Defendant taking benefit of the attractive design of the Plaintiff commenced manufacturing of similarly designed pencils and to leave no stone unturned to reap benefit from the hard earned reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff, even applied thereon trade mark ""ZORRO"", which is allegedly deceptively similar with the Plaintiff's trade mark ""ORO"". with an additional plaintiff.","When attention is drawn to J.M. No.09/2016 in terms of which cancellation of Plaintiff's registered design is sought, the grounds alleged for such a cancellation are that the design registered by the Plaintiff is not new, easily available in the local and international market thus there is no element of novelty therein which is mandatory for obtaining registration of a design. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the Defendant produced a large number of pencils manufactured by third parties, which seemingly look alike the design registered by the Plaintiff. It was contended by the counsel that the said design was introduced in 1990 by M/s. Staedtler Mars GmbH & Co. a German company for its ""Noris"" range of pencils, which have been globally sold since then. In support of his contentions, he attached copies of Noris pencils.","The residual effect of the above is that while the Plaintiff has lost his design Registered No.17023-D on account of forceful attack made by the Defendant through J.M.No.09/2016, the Defendant is still restrained from using deceptively similar ""ZORRO"" trademarked pencils embodying the typical colours scheme (trade dress) adopted by the Plaintiff.

 
","As mentioned in the foregoing, to have a design registered under the Ordinance and to have a monopoly created thereon, it is essential that the design must have element of newness or originality under section 3(2) of the Ordinance and in the absence of the said newness or originality, no design could be registered. The condition of newness and originality, which under the previous 1911 Patent and Design Act was only limited to Pakistan, was extended globally under the 2000 Ordinance meaning thereby to have a design registered under the 2000 Ordinance, the design must be globally new or original.
The term ""design"" is defined by clause (e) of section 2 of the Ordinance to mean (in the given context) features of shape, configuration, pattern ornament applied to an article by any industrial process or means, being features which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye. Subsection (2) of section 3 requires that a design not to be registered unless it was new or original and, in particular, shall not be so registered in respect of any article if it is the same as a design which before the date of the application for registration has been registered in Pakistan or published anywhere in the world in respect of the same or any other article or differs from such a design only in immaterial details or in features which are variants commonly used in the trade. Explanation to the said section provides that designs would not be new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combination of design features. It is important to keep in mind that section 3 is couched in the negative terms, and requires that the design which is not new or original cannot be registered. The expression, ""new or original"" appearing in section 3 means that the design had been invented for the first time or it has not been reproduced by anyone before. As mentioned in the foregoing, since a design is to be judged solely by the eye, the said definition read with application for registration makes it clear that the shape or particular configuration has to have visual newness or originality. Such design, once it is registered cannot be copied by any other person, as long as the design is new or original and never ever reproduced by any other person. In the case at hand a large number of triangular shaped pencils, which were produced before this Court were allegedly available in the market and such shape of triangular shaped pencils being in common knowledge for decades, hence by no stretch of imagination such pencils which have been registered by the Plaintiff could be said to be new or original and invented by the Plaintiff. A simple search in Google for the phrase ""triangular shaped pencils"" shows about over 1.7 million hits. The fact is that these triangular shaped pencils have been in use since long for teaching toddlers how to write effectively as the circular pencils are hard to be held by small hands, being easy in grip, the said design has thus been popular and widely sold for decades. In Phillips v. Barbro Rubber Company (1920) 37 R.P.C. 233, Lord Moulton emphasized that it is the duty of the court to take special care that no design is to be counted as new and original design unless it distinguished from that previously existed by something essentially new or original which is different from ordinary trade variants. The very intent of section 10 of the Ordinance is to remove registrations of such designs from the Register which were registered in violation of substantive requirements prescribed by the Ordinance. In the case at hand it is abundantly clear that the design registered by the Plaintiff is devoid of newness or originality and it could also not be said that the Plaintiff had induced creative ingenuity in this very commonly available design to the extent that the resulting design could withhold the threshold of newness or originality and stay registered as such. Accordingly, the J.M.No.09/2016 is allowed on the ground of lack of newness and originality in the Plaintiff's designed pencils.
Notwithstanding the above conclusion, a comparison of the rival pencils as shown above reveals that the Defendant has not only used identical colour scheme and getup (trade dress) of pencils used by the Plaintiff, as well as, its trade mark ""ZORRO"" embodies Plaintiff's complete trade mark ""ORO"" in full, therefore, when Moron in a Hurry test as developed by Mr. Justice Foster in the 1978 Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited [1979 FSR 113] is applied, there is no doubt that an unwary purchaser will not be deceived on account of the startling resemblances between the rival pencils. Accordingly the application filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. by the Plaintiff succeeds.

HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","C.O. No. 751 of 2010, decided on 17th May, 2017.",,,"An application under section 90(1)(b)(i) and section 80(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance"") has been filed by the applicant-company Italfarmaco S.P.A, a company existing under the laws of Italy through its authorized signatory (""the applicant""). The application has been filed for a declaration of invalidity of the entry in the Trademark Register of the trademark FERPLEX registered under No.130807 dated July 11, 1995 in class 5 for pharmaceutical preparations used as iron supplement. The trademark FERPLEX (""the trademark"") has been registered in the name of the respondent No.1 Himont Pharmaceuticals (""Himont"").
A license agreement dated 26.10.1994 was executed between the applicant and Himont regarding the manufacturing and sale of the trademark. The agreement is annexed with the application. The primary facts which form the foundation of the application are not in dispute between the parties and the parties are on common ground with regard thereto. Thus, the registration of the trademark in the name of Himont since the year 1996 was within the knowledge of the applicant and the position continued to subsist until the filing of the application for declaring the trademark as invalid. The license agreement between the parties was terminated by the applicant vide termination letter dated 27.4.2009.
It can be seen from a reading of the prayer clause of the suit filed by Himont that the suit seeks a declaration ""regarding the trademark FERPLEX"". The suit by Himont also seeks a declaration to the effect that exclusive agreement between the applicant and Himont is still valid and enforceable as also that Himont has the sole right to manufacture, market, supply, distribute and sale of the product FERPLEX in Pakistan. On 6.9.2010, the applicant also filed a suit before the District Court, Lahore under the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by the Ordinance. The suit by the applicant is for the grant of permanent injunction seeking to restrain Himont purportedly from infringing and using the trademark FERPLEX. Therefore, the suit by the applicant is also with regard to the trademark which is the subject matter of this application as well. It would be expedient to reproduce the prayer made in the suit by the applicant, which is as follow:-
""This honourable Court may further be pleased to pass/grant/direct:
a) An order directing the Defendant to recall all the stocks of its products from the market being sold under the imitated trademark FERPLEX as well as for destruction or replacement of the labels, plates, markings thereof along with destruction or handing over to the plaintiff for destruction of all the offending labels, plates, markings and other printed material bearing the imitated trademark FERPLEX.
b) To remove all figures, hoarding, boards, neon signs etc., bearing imitated trademark FERPLEX.
c) An order directing the Defendant to get all its Marketing Approval/Drug Registration for imitated trademark FERPLEX transferred to the name of the plaintiff.
d) Any other relief that this honourable Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the present case.""
Once again, it is evident from the prayer reproduced above that the injunction has been sought with regard to the trademark FERPLEX and ancillary reliefs have been asked for which inter alia include an order directing the defendant to have all its marketing approval/drug registration transferred to the name of the applicant. with a different defendant.","It is correct that Himont was a licensee of the applicant under a license agreement executed on 26.10.1994. The agreement has effectively been terminated w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Himont alleges that the agreement could not be terminated and has brought a suit before the District Court, Lahore. The parties are at variance with regard to the fact whether the agreement gave the power to Himont to have the trademark registered in its name. The parties are poles apart on the interpretation put on the different clauses of the license agreement with regard to this aspect. The applicant asserts that by the license agreement, Himont was merely conferred a license for the use of trademark FERPLEX within the territory of Pakistan. The applicant provided requisite data and information to Himont to enable it to obtain marketing approval/drug registration under the trademark FERPLEX and based on the information and data provided by the applicant, Himont succeeded in obtaining market registration from the applicant for formulating, manufacturing and selling the FERPLEX products as licensee of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the trademark was registered with the Registrar of Trademark in the name of Himont and the current application has been made by the applicant to declare as invalid the registration of the trademark."," In view of the above, C.M No.1-C of 2011 is allowed. The application is hereby returned to the applicant to be filed before the appropriate forum.
","Two grounds form the nub of the applicant's arguments with regard to the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by Himont. These grounds revolve around the true construction of provisions of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. Firstly, the learned counsel states that in fact no proceedings are pending with the District Court within the contemplation of the term as used in subsection (4) and thus, the exception to subsection (4) is not attracted so as to convince this Court to allow the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. Secondly, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the purposive construction of subsection (4) was that the choice to approach the appellate forum was retained by the applicant who brings an application under section 80 for seeking a declaration of invalidity with regard to a trademark.
the application may be made by an interested party either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thus far, the choice lies with an interested party to file an application either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thereafter follows an exception which has been provided in subsection (4). In terms of that exception if the proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court the application shall be made to the High Court or a District Court. The learned counsel for the applicant laid great stress on the aspect that the proceedings before the District Court were not proceedings within the ambit of the term as used in clause 'a' of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. This submission of the learned counsel is nuanced and has no legal legs to stand upon. The term 'proceedings' is a compendious term and includes all or any causes which are brought before the courts and on which the courts can undertake judicial proceedings. It would suffice to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as the State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) for an elaboration to the term 'proceedings'. It was held that:-
""Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, interpretation of the word 'proceeding' as interpreted in various pronouncements given above, we are of the opinion that the word 'proceedings' is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" means the instituting or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a 'proceeding' is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or judicial officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an action.""
The learned counsel for the applicant attempted to make a subtle distinction on an issue which arises peripherally from the first submission made by the learned counsel with regard to the meaning of the term 'proceedings'. He stated that the proceedings before the District Court were not regarding the use of the trademark but merely sought the cancellation of the registration of the drug with the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan. n order to understand the proposition raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, the prayers made in the suits filed by the parties before the District Court, Lahore have been brought forth above. In this application, the prayer is to the effect that the trademark registration be declared as invalid in terms of section 90(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and in the alternate it has been prayed that registration of trademarks be rectified by substituting the name of the applicant as the proprietor of the registered trademark. Therefore, the entire prayer of the applicant constitutes a request for a declaration of invalidity with regard to the trademark registered in the name of Himont. If we were to juxtapose the prayers made in this application with the one made by Himont in its suit before District Court, Lahore it would become evident that Himont has prayed for the converse of what the applicant has prayed in the instant application. 
It is under these circumstances that inter alia a declaration has been sought in the suit for the continued use of the trademark FERPLEX by Himont as also for a declaration that any use of the trademark FERPLEX by any party including the defendant shall be an act of unfair competition and in violation of Himont's commercial and equitable rights. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any of its agents from obstructing the business of Himont has also been sought. More importantly, a decree for permanent injunction has been sought restraining the applicant herein either directly or indirectly from using the trademark FERPLEX in Pakistan in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the relief claimed in the suit filed by Himont is in conflict and directly contrary to what has been asked for in the present application. 
The learned counsel for the applicant made a reference to section 72 of the Trademark Act, 1940 and referred to the words ""as the case may be"" as used in section 72 of the Act, 1940. He also referred to section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 in which in subsection (4)(a) while making a similar exception the legislature has used the words ""as the case may be"". Precisely, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the absence of these words has left a choice with the applicant to make the application to either the High Court or the District Court. This argument by the learned counsel will virtually have the effect of nullifying the intention of the legislature in providing an exception and will make the entire exception as redundant. It is trite principle and a rule of construction that redundancy cannot be attached to any provisions enacted by the legislature. If the argument of the learned counsel were to be accepted, this will mean that the application may be filed with the High Court or a District Court irrespective of the proceedings pending in the High Court or a District Court. This will have the unholy effect of making a mockery of the law and, therefore, such an interpretation could not be countenanced.
The wrongness of the argument is also evident from a consideration of the provisions of section 73 of the Ordinance. Section 73, so far as relevant, reads as under:-
73(4) An application for revocation may be made by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-
a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in case the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Subsection (4) confers the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for revocation on the Registrar. Thus, and it requires to be reemphasized, the power vests in the Registrar and nor in either the High Court or the District Court. 
The exception is couched in broad terms. The words ""if proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or, the District Court "" evince a broad-based and wide-ranging concept which is inclusive. From the meaning of the term 'proceedings' brought out in the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, there is no doubt that it embraces within it the suits filed by the parties before the District Court and the current application too. But the key word in any opinion is 'concerning'. It connotes all or any proceedings even remotely touching upon the trademark in question. The word renders the entire concept fluid and plastic without being hedged in, in any manner. If the proceedings are brought under the provisions of the Ordinance, they are necessarily proceedings concerning trademark, whether they arise out of a contact or are brought for revocation of registration or for declaring as invalid the registration of a trademark. In this case, Himont resists the application for invalidity, tooth and nail. It seeks both the license agreement and the registration to be declared as valid in the suit before the District Court. The applicant says that retention of the registration of trademark is not a specific prayer in the suit filed by Himont. That may be so but the effect of declaring the license agreement to be subsisting and valid would have the consequence of impacting the question of registration too and there is no escape from it. The use of the word 'shall' too lends actuality to the analysis and clearly brings forth the mandatory nature of the provision.
As if this was not enough, the legislature enacted section 116 to reinforce the purpose of bringing in the exception in subsection (4) of section 80. Section 116 is to the following effect:-
""116. Procedure in certain cases of option to apply to the High Court, a District Court or the Registrar- Where under this Ordinance, an applicant has the option of making an application either to the High Court or a District Court or to the Registrar-
a) if any suit or proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending before the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in any other case, if the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Once again, section 116 conceptualises the same statutory enterprise and is an overarching provision which applies to all applications made under the Ordinance. It seeks to attain the same end, that is, all decisions concerning a trademark should be consistent and made by the same forum.
The learned counsel for the applicant relied upon Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Rafiuddin v. Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 2 others (1994 MLD 874) and Iqbal Begum v. Farooq Inayat and others (PLD 1993 Lahore 183). These judgments elaborate upon the concept and contours of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary to allude to these precedents as the concept is very well settled and the issue regarding the applicability or otherwise of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. does not arise as it is not denied that in these proceedings the general provisions of civil procedure apply and in case this Court comes to the conclusion that the present proceedings are caught by the mischief of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance, this Court has the power to make necessary directions in order to give effect to those provisions and there is no cavil with this proposition.
The learned counsel for Himont referred to Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833) which was a case concerning application under section 73 of the Ordinance for the revocation of the trademark. It was held in this judgment that the application ought to be filed with the Registrar and the only exception which allows the filing of such an application before the High Court if proceedings were already pending with the High Court. This precedent can be cited as a complete answer to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has a choice to file the proceedings either before the High Court or before the District Court. Messrs H & B, General Trading Company through Director v. Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028) is a Division Bench judgment of the Karachi High Court which held that proceedings under sections 73 and 80 of the Ordinance require such proceedings to be filed before the forum where proceedings concerning the trademark is already pending. This judgment is on all fours with the facts in the instant application and primarily supports the findings rendered in the instant application. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that all such proceedings must be decided by the same forum and this was based on sound principles of administration of justice and judicial governance and proceeded thereafter to return the application to be filed at the proper forum. The appeal before the Division Bench arose out of a judgment of the Single Bench of the Karachi High Court reported as 2009 CLC 354 which substantially arrived at the same conclusion which was affirmed by the Division Bench.",KMZ/I-18/L Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

Suit No.932 and C.M.A. No.6872 of 2008, decided on 19th August, 2008.",,,"The facts relating for the purpose of the disposal of the application are that the plaintiff is affiliated with Messrs Matrix Pharma Private Limited, which covers the entire value chain within its own organization, being sole proprietorship concern for its major products enumerated as under:--
 
(i) Overine-F-(Colmiphene Citrate)-for Induction of Ovulation easily;
 
(ii) Lostaz- (Cilostazol) provides dual .action, that is inhibition of platelet aggregation and increase in vasodilation;
 
(iii) Hyalgan-(Hyaluronic Acid Sodium Salt)-for the patients of Knee Osteoarthritis;
 
(iv) Biflor-(Saccharomyces Boulardii)-For Anti-diarrheal; etc.
 
It is averred that trademark 'FOREVA Pearls' had earned good reputation and goodwill and the products and services of the Matrix. The plaintiff applied for the trademark registration; filed an application under class 5 and is also a registered proprietor of the design of the CAPSULE in class 3 under application No.13293-D filed in the patent office and holds copyright inartistic work in label designing under No.Copr-1754 with the Central Copyright Office, Karachi. In the second week of June, 2008 plaintiff learnt about the identical mark 'FOLIQAM Pearls' marketed and distributed under identical deceptively trademark and packing by the defendant No.1 managed by defendants Nos.2 to 6 set up on the basis of ex-employees of the plaintiff whereby obtained trade secrets and have started their own business.
In rebuttal defendants have filed counter affidavit denied the allegations of the plaintiff explained that none of the employees of the plaintiff connect with the business of defendant No.1, which is a sole proprietorship concern exclusively run by Mr. Farooq Shaikh who had a past marketing sale business in Pharma business, worked with Ciba, Hilton Pharma to the neonexus whereas defendants Nos.3 to 6 are employees of the defendants Nos.1 and 2. The wife of Mr. Farooq Shaikh, Professor Aisha Khan being gynecologist/ surgeon is serving in DOW Medical University as well as in OMI, Ziauddin Hospital Clifton and Parklane Hospital Clifton. The food supplement is imported from China and is advised by the gynecologist recommended for pregnant women. The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 opened an LC in April, 2007, started marketing its product 'FOLIQAM Pearl' with distinct trademark, trade name, color scheme, design, calligraphy, and are continuously importing and selling in the market by user for almost one year without any objection from any quarter. Defendants have launched six products, in competition with the plaintiff in respect of only one product. On market search from trademark registry the defendant No.1 had applied for registration of 'FALIQAM' on 28-5-2007, the plaintiff had fraudulently passed the trademark only to create confusion and to cause damage to the reputation and goodwill of the defendants and had launched on small scale 'FOLIQAM' in large pack of 5 pouches under defendant's brand name in market. The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 received notice under section 27 of the Trademark Ordinance 2001 issued in collusion with the plaintiff on the basis of forged and subsequent application for registration of 'FOLIQAM', affidavit in rejoinder was filed by the plaintiff.
 under unusual conditions.","Ms. Iqra Saleem learned counsel for plaintiff has contended that the plaintiffs right has been infringed on account of the acts of the defendants by using the trademark similar to that of the plaintiff thus the crucial question is whether the use of the word 'FOLIQAM' in the trading style of the defendant has infringed the trademark of the plaintiff? Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the use Of the word 'Pearls' by the defendant's in course of their business is an act of infringement of the right in terms of sections 39, 46(2) and (3), 67 of the Trademark Ordinance, 2007 and sections 7 and 8 of the Registered Designs Ordinance XLV of 2000. It came to the knowledge of the plaintiff in the second week of June, 2008 that an identical mark Foliqam Pearls has been marketed and distributed detriment to the plaintiff proprietor and commercial interest in its products by imitating deceptively similar trademark and packing.
Learned counsel for defendant's has contended that defendant No.2 has created its own brand which is distinctive in get up, color scheme, design calligraphy of the plaintiff in following terms:--
 
(i) Attractive and eye catching pack with red and dark pink color dominating.
 
(ii) One big and one small size swans on front and back panels of the box. Objective of this was to create an identity of Foliqam.
 
(iii) Being proud of name Aqmar, we have prominently and boldly written the name Aqmar on all the four panels of the box.
 
(iv) Since Pink is more accepted color by females, we put our best efforts to develop Foliqam soft-gel capsules in pink color. This helped us to claim that our product Foliqam is totally different from the competitor.
 
Learned counsel for defendant's has also pointed out comparison on 'Foliqam' Bottles Pack v. 'FOREVA' Bottle Pack. It is urged that from the cursory look of both the brands there are no similarities and both the brands are quite distinct and it cannot be said that the product is creating deception in the market.
 
","After the examination of the marks labels of both the parties as incorporated in the United Kingdom v. Mehran Bottlers (Private) Limited Karachi PLD 2000 Karachi 192, the well-established principles noted for deciding the question of similarity of the two marks I am of the view that over all similarities the touchstone and after adjudging both from the point of first impression of person of average intelligence the structure label, Phonetic, similarity or dissimilarity and then the wary purchasers should not put in a state of wonder what I am of the view that there is no possibility for an average wary customer to be deceived or confused from a product as the same is imported from the foreign country and both the labels are distinct on account of colour scheme and the variation in the labels of both the parties, therefore, I am not inclined to grant of injunctive relief as claimed by the plaintiff, consequent thereof C.M.A.6872 of 2008 is hereby dismissed.
 

 
","For almost one year the defendants Nos.1 and 2 are continuously using bona fide concurrent use of its products 'Foliqam Pearls' not a single incident of deception has been placed on record by the aggrieved party. The plaintiff was intending to launch 'Foliqam Pearls' in use of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 for the last 10 months within the knowledge of the plaintiff as is established from annexures B-3, B-4, B-5, B-6, B-7, B-8 and B-37 annexed with the counter-affidavit on the back of 'FOREVA PEARLS' has been changed by Matrix in January, 2008 and 'FOREVA PEARLS' is available in pack of 60 each Softgel in blister form. It will not be out of place to mention that the mark of Foliqam is too old., It is being used by the pregnant women of congenital abnormalities, which is sold in the market by many other companies such as Zafar, Nabil, Qasim, Abbot, Agb, Rg, Barbell, Hodgoson and others. It has also been pointed out that softgel capsules are imported by another competitor Forlive in rounded shape in pink colour capsules similar to that used by the defendants Nos.1 and 2 and there is nothing to suggest that the middle line in the capsules code certain right of registration as in all the capsules as middle lines are used to fill as a common features.
 
It has also revealed that the products of both the parties have not been registered under trademark registry and the applications are pending, thus the only question involved is in respect of passing off the products clothed with mis representation coupled with damages and goodwill. Much of the emphasis has been placed on unreported order passed in case of Messrs Hero Motor Ltd. by a Single Bench of this Court in Suit No.952 of 2005, in case of Bayer A.G. and another v. Macter International (Pvt.) Ltd. 2003 CLC 794; adverting to the question of deception of question as to mark used by the defendants while determining the Test Phonetic similarity of trade name of pharmaceutical product. Generic name of a pharmaceutical product could not function as a trade name to indicate its origin, points to be considered by Court in arriving at the conclusion of fact as to whether deception or confusion was likely to be caused enumerated. Whether the defendants are selling the goods so marked by design calculated to lead the public to believe that they' are the plaintiffs goods. It has further been observed as under:--
""The ultimate test is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff. The court has to compare the two marks with the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standard. The persons, who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject for consideration. The purpose of comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiffs trademark are to be found used by the defendant. When two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles with the plaintiffs registered trade mark that it is likely to deceive to cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which it is registered.""
That above rule would be applicable in judging the case of infringement but while dealing with the cases of drugs sold on prescription by the doctors, chemists and druggists, these factors assume much significance.
So far as the question of the deception and confusion created in the minds of the general public is concerned besides the packing, logo and label, prima facie, it is required to be judged with similarity has affected the business of the parties marketing the drugs, not a single instance has been produced c to substantiate that with the use of product any loss has been caused to the plaintiffs business. It is not the plaintiffs case that he had sustained any loss due to the use of the similar product in the market with colour and scheme design and calligraphy marked by the defendant. This issue came up for hearing before Division Bench of this Court in High Court Appeal No.248 of 2006 for the use of the Trade Mark 'Master'. It was observed that the 'Master' is public juris owned by the public and not by a private person and when a thing is a private property anyone can make use of it as held in cases of 1987 CLC 1448, Multani Sohan Halva, Hussain Aghahi Multan v. Registrar of Trademarks, Karachi and another 2001 SCMR 967, Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others. The plaintiff has emphasized much on the word 'Pearls' which is commonly used throughout the world. The label and the bottle used by the defendant is strikingly different with dominating features and brightly coloured therefore it will not effect the mind of the public and would not cause loss to the business word goodwill of the plaintiff.",M.B.A./S-66/K Application dismissed.,Dismissed
Competition Commission of Pakistan,"Before Dr. Muhammad Saleem, Dr. Shahzad Ansar and Ms. Bushra Naz Malik, Members
Messrs SUKKUR TESTING SERVICES (SMC-PVT.) LIMITED
","F. No. 336 / SIBA(V)STS / OFT / CCP / 2018, decided on 12th February, 2020.","12th February, 2020.",nil,"The Complainant filed a complaint against the Respondent. The Commission upon receipt of the Complaint initiated an enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act. The principle allegation in the Complaint was that the Respondent is disseminating false and misleading information to consumers through advertisements in various newspapers, claiming to be Testing Service Provider in the name and style of ""Sukkur Testing Service (STS)"", which graphically resembles to the Complainant as ""SIBA Testing Service (STS)"" and consequently damaging the Complainant's reputation, which is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant.
The SCN served to the Respondent was returned undelivered with the remarks of the courier ""Shifted"". The office of Registrar contacted the Respondent telephonically and directed to receive the SCN personally. The Respondent received the SCN and filed written reply on 10th February 2020.  with contradictory witness statements.","However based on the submissions raised by the Complainant and the Respondent, we deem it appropriate to address the following issue: Whether the Respondent has resorted to the deceptive marketing practices in violation of section 10 of the Act?","For the reasons discussed above and in line with our mandate to protect the consumers from anti-competitive behavior, including deceptive marketing practices, we hereby hold the subject conduct of the Respondent has violated provisions of section 10(1) of the Act read with section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
38. We are cognizant of the fact that marketers traditionally focus on designing advertising campaigns and other promotional strategies to promote a brand name. However, with evolving consumer preferences and laws, presentation; trade dress have become just as essential for making products and services distinctive and for building brand recall. The cultural diversity of the Pakistan market makes a compelling case for the importance of product identification by packaging and visual impression. This has resulted in third parties creating lookalikes of popular products with similar packaging or offer services through similar logos in order to grab consumers' attention and generate demand for their own products/services in the market. In our considered view, the consumers are clearly susceptible and at a serious risk of falling prey to deceptive confusion pertaining to the origin and quality of the products, due to the striking similarity in the Complainant's logo and the logo used by the Respondent.
39. In the instant matter it is on record that the Respondent had only published one advertisement i.e. the Impugned Advertisement, the last date to file application thereof was 26th November 2018. Thereafter, no further advertisements were issued by the Respondent. The Complaint was filed on 28th January 2019 and in the Enquiry Report it is also acknowledged that no other advertisement was published by the Respondent. It is on the record that the proprietor of Respondent discontinued the business through Respondent. The Respondent after the hearing in the matter has also submitted its Bank statement for the period 27th June 2018 to 12th February 2020 titled Sukkur Testing Services (SMC-PVT) Limited at Habib Bank Branch G-10 Markaz, Islamabad. From examination of advertisement and bank statement it is evident the advertisement was published in the newspapers on November 2018 and the last date of forms submission of fee was 26th November 2018. The Respondent received the fee amounting to Rs. 50, 150, 250, 300 and 450 from students for seven different posts mentioned in the advertisement. Till 26th November 2018 its account balance was Rs. 556,140.00/, The Respondent has clarified that the amount of Rs. 500,000/- (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) was returned to the Public Sector Organization and the Bank Statement shows the withdrawal of the said amount also. During the hearing the Respondent had also submitted that he is willing to comply with the directions and he will not indulge in any illegal practices in future. It is also relevant that Complainant though had claimed during the hearing that prospective consumers approached them, however, no evidence in this regard was produced before us. Further, even in the Complaint's paras (5) and (6) there is no mention that the prospective candidates approached them upon seeing the advertisement.
40. Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Act, however, the approach of the representative of the Respondent needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and the Respondent discontinued the violation during the enquiry and never repeated that violation of the Act. In addition he also apologized and assured future compliance of the Act in letter and spirit. We, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 250,000/- (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, given Respondent is directed to deposit the penalty with the Commission in two equal instalments within ninety (90) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is also reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Act.
41. In terms of the above, the Show Cause Notice No. 01 of 2020 dated 17th January 2020 is hereby disposed of.
","The concept of Consumer vis- -vis section 10 of the Act: It is clear that under the Act, the Commission is mandated to protect the consumers from anti-competitive practices prohibited. One of such practice is deceptive marketing practices, which is aimed at the consumers to make a transactional decision, Hence, it is important to determine the consumer for the purpose of assessment under section 10 of the Act. 
The concept of False or Misleading information in the process of advertising/marketing: Subsequent to understanding and clarifying the concept of Consumer, we are of the considered opinion that, it must be understood, what constitutes 'false' or 'misleading' information in the process of advertising/marketing which evokes a violation of section 10 of the Act. 
Net General Impression of the Impugned Advertisement: The third and most important aspect in order to record our findings vis-a-vis the violation of prohibition contained in section 10 of the Act, is to gather the impression of the advertisement/marketing campaign impugned. The Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e. Order in the matter of China Mobile Pak Limited and Pakistan Telecom Mobile Limited reported as 2010 CLD 1478, has held that:
""...evaluate complete advertisement and make an opinion regarding deception [...] on the basis of net general impression conveyed by them and not an isolated script"".
Material Information: With reference to the materiality of the representation, reference can be made to the FTC Policy Statement on Deception dated 14.10.1983 appended to Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 174 (1984), wherein it is provided that the commission, omission, or practice must be a 'material' one which is likely to affect the consumer's conduct or decision with regard to a product or service. This was also endorsed by the Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e., Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zone and Ufone reported as 2010 CLD 1478.
28. We take into account the overall net general impression of the Impugned Advertisement, we cannot ignore the fact that similar acronym used by the Respondent might confuse the Consumers/ prospective candidates about the goodwill and status of the Testing Service. Hence, we are of the opinion that the Respondent by using the similar acronym is in fact passing off its services and misleading the consumers about its association with the Complainant.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, using of similar acronym by the Respondent gives the Consumers an impression that either the Impugned Advertisement is issued by the Complainant or the Respondent is somehow associated or affiliated with the Complainant. Further, the word `Sukkur' also can confuse the consumers about the information disseminated through the Impugned Advertisement that the services being offered to attract prospective candidates are by the Complainant. In response we note that the Respondent has not provided any evidence which substantiate that the Respondent is associated with the Complainant. Further, the use of similar acronym and words Sukkur in the Impugned Advertisement seems to be a conscious attempt by the Respondent to capitalize on the goodwill and standing of the Complainant. Hence, we are of the considered view that in the instant matter a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(b) is made out.
31. Fraudulent Use of Trademark: With reference to the fraudulent use of trademark, it is on the record that the Complainant had applied for registration of trademark in the name and style of ""SIBA Testing Services"" vide application dated 22nd February, 2019 i.e. even after filing the Complaint with the Commission. We are also conscious of the fact that the trademark is not registered in favour of any of the parties. Although the Complainant, from the material available on the record, is a prior user; however, the ownership is yet to be conferred by the Trademarks Registry under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
We are cognizant of the fact that the scope of proceedings under section 10 of the Act is restricted only to the extent of deceptive marketing practices. We are not conferred with the power by the legislature to determine the right to ownership of any undertakings vis- -vis the trademark. The assessment in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act i.e. fraudulent use of another's trademark, can only be carried out where the ownership is granted or acquired under any law i.e. the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, a similar situation exists in the instant matter, as the trademark is not registered in the name of either party, hence, any findings vis-a-vis the ownership of the trademark would be beyond the scope of section 10 of the Act and would be construed as encroaching upon the domain of Trademark Registrar under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, we are of the considered view that a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act cannot be proved in the instant matter.
. Information Capable of Harming the Business Interest of other undertakings: Now turning to section 10(2)(a) of the Act, according to which 'the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. We are guided by one of Commission's earlier Order i.e. Order dated 21st December, 2012 in the matter of Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd, 2013 CLD 1014, wherein the Commission had observed that ""it is important to recognize that part of any business' identity is the goodwill it has established with consumers, while part of a product's identity is the reputation it has earned for quality and value"". We are also guide by, Order dated 17 March 2015 in the matter of M/S Jotun Pakistan (Pvt) Limited, 2015 CLD 1638, the Commission had held that ""To prove conduct under section 10(2)(a) of the Act, it is not necessary to show actual harm to competitors. It is sufficient to show the existence of a deceptive marketing practice that has the potential to harm the business interests of the competitors."" (emphasis added).
It is also pertinent to mention that in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act read with 10(2)(b) or (c) or (d) of the Act, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out. The consequence of the distribution of information to the public that is false or misleading is that it is capable of harming the business interests of and resulting in fatal consequences for the competitors of the undertaking making such deceptive claims. It may also be clarified at this point that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than the other sub-sections of section 10(2). It was observed by the Commission in its Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs A. Rahim Foods {Private) Limited, 2016 CLD 1128, that ""While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section I0(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise"". The same rationale is applicable to Section 10(2)(b) of the Act, as it is to section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

Mrs. QURAT-UL-AIN MANSOOR and others---Respondents
 

","H.C.As. Nos.151, 152 and 153 of 2015, decided on 10th February, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","The appellant, a partnership firm established in the year 2002 for providing beauty salon and parlor services in Karachi claims to have commenced its business since its inception under the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"". On the other hand, the respondent claims to have set up beauty salon and parlor in Lahore as early as 1990 and contends that the appellant was her employee when Alle'nora commenced its branch operations in Karachi in 2002. The dispute between the parties is in relation to trade mark and trade name (hereinafter referred to as trade mark) ""ALLE'NORA"" used by them which has resulted in three suits and counter suits agitated by one against the other. The above referred impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge was passed accordingly in respect of all three suits heard together adjudicating claim as to the ownership of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark between the said two contestants. An analytical look at the impugned judgment depicts that the learned Single Judge has very carefully crafted three important issues, being (i) which of the parties is a prior user of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Pakistan; (ii) has any of the parties a right to the exclusive use of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" anywhere in Pakistan; and (iii) is the prior user so determined is entitled to the relief claimed in their respective suits?
 The admitted facts are that the respondent has established that it has a prior use commencing from the year 1990 in Lahore in respect of the above referred trade mark, as well as, it has also registered the said trade mark with the Trade Mark Registry, Government of Pakistan in Class 44 effective from 29.07.2006. On the other hand, the appellant as stated to in the foregoing, upon creation of its partnership in 2002 admits to have commenced use of trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Karachi and has filed an application for registration of trade mark on 14.11.2006 and an application for registration of copyright with the Pakistan Copyright Registry on the same date, which applications are pending. It cannot be ignored that in both the said applications, the applicants has claimed use of the said trade mark since 2002 only.
 with a different defendant.","While we observe that the order of the learned Single Judge has very aptly addressed to the various issues raised by the counsel of the appellant, however, the following two contentions of the counsel crave for further deliberations:
 (a) The ingredients and test required to establish honest and concurrent use of trade marks; and
 (b) The defense of geographical distances while using another trader's trade mark.
","We, therefore, do not find any force in the assertion either that someone else's trade mark could be used in another part of the country just because the original trader had decided not to open the branch or put his presence in other part of the country or the goods carrying with trade mark are not made available to some other parts within the country. These appeals thus have no merit.
These are the reasons of short order passed in Court on 10.02.2016 dismissing the above referred appeals.","With regard to the first issue, the learned counsel relied on the above referred 1947 judgment, which has been distinguished by us as to its limitation towards latter's applicability in the instant case. Thus the above citation does not satisfy us. It is an established global understanding that the key concept behind trade mark jurisdiction revolves around protection against confusion, deception and fraud. The very purpose an honest trader choses a distinctive or novel trade mark is to keep his goods or service distant from the possibility of being taken as a competitor's goods or services. The very reasons for the creation of an intellectual property legal system is to provide for a mechanism for the protection and offering rewards to creativity and fair trade. 
In the instant case, the trade mark in question is ""ALLE'NORA"", which admittedly was first used by the respondent in Lahore as early as 1990, and was used by the appellant, who admittedly commenced their business in Karachi in the year 2002. One can easily understand that in the year 2002 when the appellant commenced their business in Karachi, they had on their drawing board (or computer screens) a copy of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark used by the respondent in Lahore. The appellant decided to select the said trade mark of the respondent in identical type-font, colors and calligraphy with the sole objective to get benefit from the existence of the respondent's earlier trade mark existing in the market place and to reap benefits from the well-earned reputation of the said trade mark. When the counsel for the appellant was asked to satisfy this Court as to why each and every essential element of the respondent's trade mark is present in the trade mark used or proposed to be used by the appellant, the learned counsel had no answer except to say it is purely by co-incidence, he, however tried to defend his case by alleging that even if the appellant has used each and every essential feature, font, colour and style of the respondent's trade mark, but his client has put her name (Aliya Tipu) in the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" to distinguish her business apart from the possibility of creation of any confusion between the ""ALLE'NORA"" of Lahore and ""ALLE'NORA"" of Karachi. The Court reverted holding that the very fact that a trader uses a prominent or substantial part of some body's else trade mark with a prefix, suffix or with any other element along with the earlier trade mark, all he is doing is to admit to the existence of the prior trade mark, and trying to come under the umbrella of the earlier trade mark attempting to fool the general public that his goods and services are as good as these provided by the owner of the earlier trade mark, but he is not the original person. 
In today's world, reputation and goodwill of a trade spreads at the speed of light. The goodwill acquired by the respondent in Lahore is not necessarily limited to that city where the services were available. The admitted fact is that these services were duly advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and internet having circulation to all over the country, and even abroad. It is also an established view in trade mark jurisdiction that goodwill or reputation does not depend upon the availability of goods/services any more. We would even come to the extent to say that even if a manufacturer or service provider suspends his business activity in a particular part of the country, the cloud of the reputation and goodwill stays there even afterwards, unless it is washed away by the winds of change. The Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is based on equitable principles wherein if a person by hard work had established a goodwill or reputation in one part of the country, the law in terms of Section 1(2) protects such reputation and goodwill throughout Pakistan. The relevant territory under the said Ordinance is the whole of Pakistan and that the relevant public consisted of both the general public and interested customers across the country.
 Notwithstanding a registered trade mark, even in cases where the trade mark is not registered, reputation and goodwill in a trade mark can be protected, pursuant to the procedure laid down in the said Ordinance by granting an option of filing a passing off action. For this reason, the legal system is built upon protecting the hard work, ingenuity and goodwill of a person who is first one to use a trade mark, trade name or any other similar source identifier (including domain name, etc.) from the attacks made by competitors. The established legal principle that whenever rights in a trade mark (whether registered or not), are attacked, the wheel of the legal system will spin in the direction of protecting the honest and first adopter in order to safeguard his hard earned reputation and as well as to save customers from such disguise.
 In this regard, the age-old principles set by the apex Court formulated in Tabaq Restaurant (Lahore) v. Tabaq Restaurant (Rawalpindi) in 1987 SCMR 1090 are beacon of guidance. The dispute, as the titles suggests, was in relation to use of Tabaq trade mark in Lahore of any earlier date, which was adopted by a competing restaurant in Rawalpindi. The apex Court laid down the principle that notwithstanding the geographical distances, a trade mark owner receives protection against use of his mark by another in such a away as is likely to lead consumers to associate the other's goods with the trade mark owner.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 64 of 2017, decided on 12th January, 2018.","27th November, 2017","MRS. ASHRAF JAHAN, J.","The facts leading to the present appeal as per case of the Appellant are that they are proprietor of ""Moonlite Trading Company"", (hereinafter referred to as (""the Appellant Company""), which is a merchant, importer and marketer of self-designed consumer goods and other items. Since last several decades the Appellant Company is carrying the business of merchant and import of consumer goods including lotions, toiletries, perfumes, deodorants, air-fresheners, diapers and insecticides in Pakistan. The products imported by the Appellant Company are being marketed and sold under various Trade Marks, which include Cobra, Lotion Cobra, Soft Touch, Ku Ku, Lotion Saffire, Mascot, etc. They have also developed distinctive designs, logos or artwork for use in connection with the aforesaid brands including Appellant's current and long standing Trade Mark ""COBRA"". Therefore, in its pursuance, the Appellant Company obtained registration of the Trade Mark ""COBRA"" under Registration No.99323 in international class 05 since 11.08.1988 under the Ordinance, 2001, which registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes till today. In order to further strengthen its proprietorship, the Appellant either directly or through their company has also secured copyright registration under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962. The Appellant's product bearing ""COBRA"" has been and continued to be sold and promoted extensively throughout Pakistan since year 1988 without any hindrance from any quarter and thus they had invested substantial amount in the promotion and publicity of the product bearing ""COBRA"" mark and therefore, the Appellant company enjoys an enviable reputation and goodwill in the said Trade Mark in Pakistan.
It is further the case of the Appellant that on or about 31.03.2010, Respondent No.2 applied for the Registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", which was accepted for publication in the Trade Mark Journal in order to invite Opposition and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 733 in the month of February, 2012. Immediately upon becoming aware of such publication, the Appellant filed a Notice of Opposition bearing Opposition No.455/2013 against the grant of Registration of Mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" on the ground, inter alia, that the Trade Mark applied for is identical to the Appellant's trade mark ""COBRA"" and is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the consumers. In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Opposition, Respondent No.2 filed its counter statement contending that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was adopted in 2009 in order to distinguish its goods from other competitors and Notice of Opposition is liable to be dismissed on the ground that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is quite distinguishable from the Appellant's mark ""COBRA"", thus, qualifies for registration.
Subsequently, in January, 2014 it came to the Appellant's knowledge that Respondent No.2 in connivance with others had commenced their illegal activities of importing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and selling their goods in Karachi under the name and style of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", therefore, immediately upon becoming aware of such illegal activities, the Appellant filed Suit No.192/2014 against Respondent No.2 for infringement of rights, passing off, unfair competition, declaration and permanent injunction. In these proceedings vide order dated 03.02.2014 interim injunction was also passed, restraining Respondent No.2 from using mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". During the pendency of above suit and proceedings in Opposition No.455/2013, Appellant came to know that Respondent No.2 in the present appeal illegally obtained Trade Mark Registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", thereafter a detailed order was passed on 06.06.2014 in Suit No.192/2014, whereby the Appellant was required to file an application for invalidation of registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". Meanwhile, Respondent No.2 filed H.C.A. No.220/2014 against the order dated 06.06.2014 passed by the Single Bench in Suit No.192/2014 and the said order of Single Judge was suspended by the Division Bench vide its order dated 25.09.2014. The appeal was dismissed and the matter was remanded to the learned Single Judge to decide the injunction application in Suit No.192/2014. On 13.03.2017, an order was passed, whereby the registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was held as null and void and Respondent No.1 was directed to proceed with Opposition No.455/2013 and to pass a speaking order within thirty days. As a result thereof, the cancellation of the illegal registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing application No.280917 in class 5 was confirmed in Trade Marks Journal No.794 dated 01.03.2017. Opposition No.455/2013 came up for final hearing on 04.05.2017 before Respondent No.1 and subsequently on 10.08.2017 short order dated 07.08.2017 was communicated to the Appellant, disallowing the Opposition of the Appellant and allowing the application bearing No.280917 in class 5 of Respondent No.2 to proceed with registration with the disclaimer of word ""Cobra"" and all descriptive words/letters/device appearing on the label.
As the above order was received to the Appellant on 10.08.2017, they applied for certified copy of the decision, but the same was not communicated, hence they filed appeal only on the basis of short order communicated to them. However, subsequently, in compliance of Court's order dated 20.11.2017 detailed order was supplied to the parties, which is impugned by way of present appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed Counter Affidavit to this appeal and denied all the allegations/averments/statements made in the memorandum of titled appeal and supported the impugned order.
 under unusual conditions.","It is contended by learned counsel for the Appellant that the impugned order has been passed, ignoring the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the provisions of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; in particular section 17 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been wrongly applied by Respondent No.1 while passing the order. Per learned counsel, the product bearing mark ""COBRA"" continued to be in use in Pakistan by the present Appellant since 1987 and the Appellant is the proprietor of the mark ""COBRA"" bearing Registration Nos.99323 and 106208 in classes 5 and 16 respectively; the earliest registration was obtained in the year 1988. The Respondent No.1 for arriving at the decision in respect of Opposition No.455/2013 has ignored and misconstrued the orders dated 13.02.2017, 20.02.2017 and 13.03.2017 passed by this Court in J.M. No.34/2014, wherein learned Judge clearly observed in the order that the trade mark registration was nearly identical, therefore, was in violation of the trade mark laws. This being the position, impugned decision passed by Respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
On the other hand, it is contended by learned counsel for Respondent No.2 that Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of import and for its products of insecticides had used trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", since year 2009. Per learned counsel, the Respondent's products under the Ordinance, 2001 referred to above are sold in Pakistan since 2009 onwards and expenditure of millions of rupees is incurred upon the advertisement of such products and it was well in knowledge of the Appellant since 2009, but they remained silent; neither objected nor otherwise filed any suit to restrain Respondent No.2 from using trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" and it is only in the month of February, 2014 after a delay of almost five years, they filed Suit No.192/2014 and obtained ex parte ad-interim injunction order in the suit, whereby Respondent No.2 was restrained from using its proprietor trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"".",For the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of Respondent No.1 is set aside and the Opposition No.455/2013 filed by the appellant is allowed. The application of Respondent No.2 bearing No.280917 is rejected.,"It is contended by learned counsel that the word ""COBRA"" per se is descriptive, suggestive and common to trade in relation to insecticides and herbicides; therefore, provisions of section 17 subject to provision of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001 are not applicable to the present case. They have got only registered their label and have not obtained any registration for the word ""COBRA"". Presently a larger number of competitors of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 are selling their insect killing products in various parts of the world including Pakistan using descriptive, suggestive and common to trade word ""COBRA"" and no confusion and deception has been caused to any person, therefore, in the light of above factual and legal position, Respondent No.1 has rightly passed the order, which has been impugned before this Court with wrong perception and ulterior motives. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following case law:
2013 CLD 330 (Tillotts Pharma AG v. GETZ Pharma (Private) Limited.)
1989 SCMR 361 (Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd.)
2007 CLD 991 (Messrs Master Textile Mills Ltd. v. Master Fabrics)
2007 CLD 997 (Abid Aziz Khan and 2 others v. Bank of Punjab).
Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 submitted that the order passed by Respondent No.1 has been passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the impugned order is valid and needs no interference at this stage.
Reasoning and Analysis
I have considered the arguments advanced before me by both the sides and have perused the case record.
To commence with, the material placed on record shows that so far as the claim of the Appellant as regards registration of trade mark ""COBRA"" and its prior use, disclosed in paragraphs two to five of the memo of appeal is concerned, it is an undeniable reality established on record; therefore, it needs no further discussion. Moreover, from the contents of earlier order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34/2014 it is also established that earlier certificate for registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing No.138268 dated 24.02.2014 in relation to trade mark No.280917 was issued by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 in blatant violation of the scheme of trade mark laws and thus declared null and void, which position was conceded before the Court by Respondent No.1 and not much disputed by Respondent No.2. In this background now it is to be seen that how far the subsequent impugned order dated 07.08.2017 passed by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 once again affirming the earlier stance (reasons recorded on 20.09.2017) is legal and within the frame work of the Ordinance, 2001. In this context firstly it is to be noted that purported prior use of trade mark ""COBRA"" by Respondent No.2 on the strength of earlier order of Respondent No.1, which was set aside by this Court vide order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34 of 2014 was nullity and void thus such period could not be considered by the Respondent No.1 as valid ground to justify the subsequent impugned order; observations of Respondent No.1 for this purpose are therefore ill-founded and perverse. Based on these facts there is no difficulty for me to hold that on one side the claim of Appellant regarding registration and use of trade mark ""COBRA"" is fully established and on the other side the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in the same category of goods is on weak footings, unless the Respondent No.2 could satisfy that use of prefix 'faster black' in their label before ""COBRA"" is sufficient to dislodge the opposition No.455 of 2013 filed by the Appellant. I have called for the samples of both the respective products from the learned counsel for the appellant and Respondent No.2 and by placing them in juxtaposition carefully examined the same, with reference to labels of ""COBRA"" and ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", and also the package material, size, shape, colour scheme and overall printed text. For ready reference their picture is placed below, which depicts similarities in the two products, sufficient to cause confusion among the ordinary customers.
The main guiding principle to examine the genuineness of the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for the registration of its trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is that upon comparison of the two, the Court is to be satisfied that there are sufficient features to differentiate between the two trade marks phonetically as well as visually, so that an unwary buyer of the same product, as in the instant matter, is genuinely not confused and misguided due to the feature of similarities between the two. In my considered opinion, the concept of totality of impression, test of average consumer etc. recorded by the Respondent No.1 in its order dated 20.09.2017 is misconceived and erroneous. As observed by me there are sound reasons disclosed by the Appellant in his Opposition No.455/2013, which justify grant of such opposition and consequent rejection of Application of 280917 in class 5 of registration of Trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in favour of Respondent No.2. This view of the matter is supported from the following judgments of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which are of binding nature:
PLD 1984 Supreme Court 8 (Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another).
PLD 1990 Supreme Court 313 (Seven-Up Company v. Kohinoor Thread Ball Factory and 3 others).

","Suit Nos.1461 and 1584 of 2013, decided on 19th January, 2015.",,,"IMC and Axact represent two large business houses, the former being part of the well known Jang/Geo group while the latter (on its own showing) is engaged in the information technology (IT) business and now intends to move into the multi-media world of broadcast by way of television, print and digital media and entertainment. Classes 38 and 41 relate to services, the former encompassing telecommunication services while the latter relates to ""education, providing of training, entertainment, sporting and cultural activities"". IMC claims to be the proprietor of ""Bol"" as a registered trademark in class 41. Its case is that it was entered on the Register of Trade Marks as the proprietor of the mark on or about 7-11-2013 on its application No. 238904, which was filed on 11-6-2007. It claims to have another application No. 195773 pending for registration of ""Bol"" as a trademark in class 38. That application appears to have been filed on or about 15-5-2004. There is apparently another application, 342080, that IMC has pending for registration of ""Bol"" in class 38, though this application was filed many years later (on or about 19-6-2013). Be that as it may, IMC's grievance is that Axact intends to use and/or has started using ""Bol"" in a manner that infringes its registered trademark (in terms of the aforementioned -application No. 238904). Suit 1461 of 2013 is therefore essentially a straightforward suit for trademark infringement. C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 has been filed therein to restrain Axact from infringing the aforesaid trademark. The suit was filed on 19-11-2013 and the said application came up before me on the same day, when I made an ad interim order. That order continues to remain in the field.
Axact strongly contests IMC's claim. Its case is that it is entitled to have ""Bol"" registered as a trademark in terms as stated above, for which it has as many as 156 applications pending in various classes. Axact's case is that there is in fact no such registration and that IMC has forged, fabricated and manipulated the official record to claim a right which it does not have and to which it is not entitled. More precisely, its case is that application No. 238904 on the basis of which IMC claims its registered trademark was not made in relation to ""Bol"" at all but rather in respect of an altogether different mark. However, subsequently the record was manipulated and fabricated to show that IMC had a registered trademark. y this application, Axact seeks interim injunctive relief to restrain IMC from claiming to be the ""owner/proprietor/applicant"" for registration of ""Bol"" and for it to be restrained from pursuing the three applications mentioned above, i.e., application Nos. 238904, 195773 and 342080. The second application filed by Axact was C.M.A. 13904 of 2013. By this application Axact sought an order that the Nazir of the Court take the entire record in relation to application Nos. 238904 and 195773 in his custody. The said application was allowed by a learned single Judge on 13-12-2013. 
 under heightened security.","The principal contest between IMC and Axact over the use and registration of the word ""Bol"" as a trademark in classes 38 and 41.
Whether IMC's application No. 238904 for ""Bol"" as a registered trademark was valid and properly registered.
Whether Axact's allegations of forgery, fabrication, and manipulation of the official record by IMC have merit.
The legality and validity of the certificate of registration of ""Bol"" relied upon by IMC.
The propriety of the Registrar's routine practice of advertising applications before acceptance.","Subject to, and in terms of, what has been stated herein above, both C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 in Suit 1461 of 2013 and C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 in Suit 1584 of 2013 are dismissed.","A certificate purporting to be issued under the hand of the Registrar as to any entry, matter or thing that he is authorised by this Ordinance or the rules to make or do shall be prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and of the contents thereof, or of the matter or thing having been done or not done.
Registration.---(1) Where an application has been accepted and (a) no notice of opposition has been given within the period referred to in subsection (2) of section 28 ... the Registrar shall, within such period as may be prescribed, register the trade mark, unless it appears to him having regard to matters coming to his notice since he accepted the application that it was accepted in error.
On the registration of a trade mark the Registrar shall publish the registration in the prescribed manner and issue to the applicant a certificate in the prescribed form of registration, sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.
Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity.---In all legal proceedings relation to a trade mark registered under this Ordinance ... the fact that a person is registered as proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmission thereof.
if no opposition is filed to the mark as advertised within the stipulated period (or no application is made, within the said period, for extension of time) to make an entry on the Register in the prescribed manner (section 33(1)). Such entry is prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration of the mark in favor of the applicant as the proprietor thereof (section 43). Once the entry has been made the Registrar is bound to issue an appropriate certificate to the applicant under the seal of the Trade Marks Registry (section 33(4)). Such certificate is prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and the contents thereof (section 11). In a suit for infringement of a registered trademark when such a certificate is produced, in the normal course it has the effect as just stated. This may be only on a prima there basis but that, after all, is all that is required for an application for interim injunctive relief. 
In my view, given that the certificate relied upon is not issued by the Registrar himself, the position adopted by the official defendants in the Written Statement must be given primacy. The position there is that no certificate ""duly signed and stamped by the competent authority"" has been issued. Furthermore, I note that in the Written Statement, the official defendants have avoided stating that, in fact, ""Bol"" is properly registered as a trademark in favor of IMC in class 41 on the Register. The certificate must be issued by the Registrar or by an officer of the Registry authorized in terms of section 7(2). Mrs. Nasreen Akhtar was obviously not the Registrar and from what has been said in para 18 of the Written Statement, not authorized to issue the certificate. On any view of the matter therefore, the stance of the official defendants is clear; there is no certificate of or evidencing, registration in the field as has, or can have, legal validity. Indeed, section 11(1) appears to suggest that this is all the evidence that is required. Therefore, if such certificate, as presented by the plaintiff, is categorically denied by the Registrar, then the effect of such denial is clear: there is no prima facie basis on which it can be concluded that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark claimed. 
Sections 27 and 28 of the 2001 Ordinance, as presently relevant. Section 27 requires is that if, after examination of the application and the required search, the Registrar is of the view 'that there are any objections to the application, he must notify the applicant and give him an opportunity to either satisfy the Registrar that the application is, in fact and law, compliant with statutory requirements or to amend it suitably to bring it in line with what is required and permissible. If either of these eventualities is not met, then the Registrar must refuse to accept the application. 
Opposition to registration---(1) When an application far registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted, to be advertised in the prescribed manner:
Provided that the Registrar may cause an application to be advertised before acceptance if it relates to a trade mark to which clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 6 applies, or in any other case where it appears to him that it is expedient by reason of any exceptional circumstances so to do, and where an application has been so advertised the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, advertise it again when it has been accepted, but shall not be bound so to do. It will be seen that this provision was similar to section 28(1). (Section 14 of the previous Act was similar to the present section 27.) There are however two important differences. Firstly, the proviso to section 15(1) comprised of two parts. It could be invoked either (a) in respect of a mark to which section 6(1)(e) of the 1940 Act applied or (b) in any other case where ""exceptional circumstances"" were found to exist. The first proviso to section 28(1) only applies if ""exceptional circumstances"" exist and not otherwise. Secondly, the second proviso to section 28(1) is new: it had no equivalent in the 1940 Act. Now, section 6 of the 1940 Act provided for the distinctiveness that was required of a mark for it to be registered. Subsection (1) provided that a mark would not be registered unless it consisted of any one of the ""essential particulars"" as stated in clauses (a) to (e) thereof.
under the 1940 Act a practice may have arisen that in respect of all applications in which section 6(1)(e) applied to the mark sought to be registered, the Registrar routinely allowed the application to be advertised before acceptance. Once the 2001 Ordinance came into effect, this practice has continued, essentially as a holdover from what was happening previously. However, if so (and even otherwise), in my view such a practice and the routine application of the first proviso under section 28(1) is clearly contrary to law. This is so because the first proviso can apply if, and only if, ""exceptional circumstances"" are shown to exist and not otherwise. This requirement applies to all cases and there is no separate category as was to be found in the proviso to section 15(1). Now, ""exceptional circumstances"" are precisely that: circumstances of such a rare or unusual nature as would warrant departure from the main rule, namely that an application is only to be advertised if accepted. 
I turn to the second proviso to section 28(1) which is mandatory. he manner in which the Registrar is to ""simultaneously notify"" the ""exceptional circumstances"" which led him to allow advertisement before acceptance can only be for such circumstances to be stated in the advertisement itself. While this follows ineluctably from the language of the second proviso, the point is expressly made in Rule 29 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004. Sub-rule (1) lists the particulars that must go in the advertisement and clause (i) thereof requires that the ""details of special circumstances, if any, under the proviso to subsection (1) of section 28"" must be given.
I conclude that at present IMC has failed to make out a prima facie case that it is the proprietor of the registered trademark ""Bol"" in class 41 on its application No. 238904. Accordingly, its present application is Suit 1461 of 2013, C.M.A. 12775 of 2013, must necessarily fail. Subject to what is stated hereafter, this application is therefore dismissed and the ad interim order made earlier stands recalled and vacated. As noted above, the official defendants have indicated that there is some inquiry ongoing at the Registry with regard to IMC's various applications and in particular application No. 238904. Taking up this application I direct that the official defendants must conclude such inquiry (if not already completed) within 30 days from the date of announcement of this Order. No opportunity of hearing need be given to either IMC or Axact (or any other person) but the results of the inquiry and the report thereon must be provided to them, and a copy of the same placed on the record in both Suits. In particular the report must address and record a clear finding whether, on IMC's application No.238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark. If the finding is that there is no such entry, then IMC's application No. 238904 shall be deemed pending. Since it was advertised under the first proviso in a manner contrary to law, the Registrar must then consider whether the application is to be accepted in terms as required by section 27 read with any other applicable provisions. If accepted (either absolutely or conditionally) then the application must be re-advertised and Axact (and any other person) shall then be entitled to file opposition on such re-advertisement in accordance with law. In its opposition, Axact will be entitled to take all such grounds as are admissible including the ground (as appears to be its case) that the application has been unlawfully allowed to be amended in violation of the first proviso to section 27(7). On the other hand, if the finding recorded in the inquiry is that on IMC's application No. 238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark, then the date of such finding or the date of this Order (whichever is later) shall be deemed to be the date of the decision of the Registrar and the date on which the trademark is, in fact, registered. Axact will be entitled to its statutory remedies, if any, accordingly. Furthermore, in such a situation IMC shall be entitled to renew its application for interim injunctive relief in Suit 1461 of 2013 which, if filed, will be taken up and decided on its own merits.
I turn to Axact's application C.M.A. 13905/2013 in its Suit 1584 of 2013. I can see no reason why this application should be allowed. As already noted in respect of application No. 195773, the same has been advertised and is being opposed by Axact. Application No. 342080 is still under examination at the Registry and will be dealt with in accordance with law, especially as explained herein above. The third application, No. 238904, has already been dealt with herein above. Since all the applications can be, and will be, dealt with under the relevant provisions of the 2001 Ordinance, I see no reason why an interim injunctive order should be made in relation thereto in terms as sought. Subject to what has been stated herein before, C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 is therefore dismissed.
In order to enable further proceedings to be taken, both in terms as stated herein above and under the 2001 Ordinance, the Nazir is directed to return the record taken by him in custody under the order made in Suit 1584 of 2013. However, before doing so he must suitably endorse/mark each page for identification purposes and retain a copy of the record so endorsed/marked and provide copies of the same to IMC and Axact. The record will be handed over to an officer not below the rank of Deputy Registrar who must be authorized in this regard by the Registrar himself. The Registrar must provide, on a monthly basis, copies (suitably marked and under an appropriate letter of intimation) to the Nazir of all documents subsequently filed in the record being returned and printouts of any computer entries made, amended, varied or deleted (whether in respect of the Register or otherwise). The Nazir will keep such copies along with the earlier copy.
I note from the file of Suit 1461 of 2013 that Axact has certain applications pending under Order VII, Rule 11 and section 10, C.P.C. on account of the Lahore suit. These applications may be listed and be heard and disposed of on their own merits notwithstanding what has been stated in the foregoing. I may also note that whatever has been said herein above is tentative in nature and the two Suits, should they go to trial, will be disposed of on their own merits and in terms of the evidence as recorded.
Finally, the Registrar is directed, since the matter is of importance and general application and interest, that paras 13 to 19 of this Order (both inclusive) and this para (and only these paras) must be published in the next issue of the Trade Marks Journal as is published on or after 15 days from the date of announcement of this Order. A copy of the relevant issue of the Journal must be sent to the Additional Registrar (OS), who will ensure that it is placed on the file of Suit 1461 of 2013.

","F.A.O. No. 158 of 2005, decided on 28th February, 2007.",,,"The appellant through the instant appeal has assailed the order of the Additional District Judge/Trial Court dated 27-5-2005 whereby, he accepted the application of respondent No.1 for grant of temporary injunction.
The facts giving rise to the present appeal are that respondent No.1 filed a suit for permanent injunction against the appellant and respondent No.2, under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 prayed for restraining defendants from infringing the registered trade mark and property mark ""Asia"" of respondent No.1/plaintiff. The suit was accompanied by an application for temporary injunction. The appellant contested the suit and filed written statement as well as reply to application for temporary injunction. Learned trial Court after hearing the parties proceeded to accept the application for temporary injunction, resultantly appellant No.1 was restrained from using the trade mark of ""Asia"" by adding word ""Super"" in the inner stage. Appellant was also restrained from manufacturing all items including the fans in the name and style of ""Super Asia"". Respondent No.2 was restrained from selling the items, manufactured by appellant No.1. Hence, this appeal assailing the order of the trial Court.
 under different legal circumstances.","Learned counsel for the appellant at the very outset has submitted that the respondents herein opposed the registration of trade mark of the appellants ""Super Asia"" in the earlier litigation, on the identical grounds, which are now subject-matter of suit. The moot question 'whether or not the trade mark ""Super Asia"" resemble with that of respondents' trade mark ""Asia"" remained under consideration in previous litigation. It was held after comparing both ""trade marks that both trade marks are different. The findings/orders of this Court dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.199 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. M/s Mohd Din and Sons), established that the plaintiff/respondent has no prima facie case. As per provisions of Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 the decision of this Court was binding on subordinate Courts but this legal aspect was totally ignored by the learned trial Court. Learned counsel then submitted that the registered trade mark of the respondent is subject to disclaimer, which fact is evident from the perusal of registration. Learned counsel went on to argue that the word ""Asia"" being geographical name cannot be registered. Registration of trade mark of the respondent violates the provisions of sections 6 and 13 of Trade Marks Act, 1940. Learned counsel has referred to the case of Anwar Industries Limited v. Muhammad Ishaque Gondal and others (1988 CLC 489) to contend that the trade mark of the respondent, could not be allowed to monopolize a common geographical name ""Asia"". Learned counsel has submitted that the appellant's enterprise being much bigger in size, prior in business and manufacturer of a large number of products as compared to that one of the respondent, cannot be restrained from using its trade mark. He lastly summed up his assertions by submitting that while passing the impugned order learned trial Court has neglected these factors, which were essential to weigh the balance of convenience and irreparable loss.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has fully supported the impugned order. Learned counsel has submitted that the respondent is registered proprietor of Trade Mark ""Asia"" since 23-6-1965. The trade mark of appellant qua the fans is black capsulated spot on white and green background with the word ""Asia"" on it. The registered trade mark of the appellant under the name of ""Super Asia"" does not pertain to fan, it relates to manufacture of goods, other than fans. Learned counsel has submitted that order dated 26-10-1986 passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 finds no mention in the written statement and as such cannot be considered in the case in hand. Case of Ehtesham ud Din Qureshi v. Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation Ltd. and others (2004 MLD 361) was referred to 'support this contention. Learned counsel while discussing the scope, extent and infringement of trade mark has referred to the cases of Messrs Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Limited and others (2001 SCMR 967), Messrs Tabaq Resturant v. Messrs Tabaq Resturant (1987 SCMR 1090) and Unilever PLC v. Al-Alameen Industries (2003 CLD 623). Learned counsel has referred to the cases of M. Sikandar Sultan v. Masih Ahmad Sheikh (2003 CLD 26), Telebrands Corporation through Attorney v. Telebrands Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2006 CLD 580) and Khawaja Tahir Jamal v. Messrs A.R. Fehman Glass (2005 CLD 1768). With reference to case-law, referred, it was contended that the registration of trade mark is meant for the benefit of trader and to protect the public to be mislead or deceived, and for free enjoyment right of manufacturing and marketing products. Learned counsel lastly contended that though the trade mark of the respondent is registered subject to disclaimer yet the registered proprietor can claim monopoly in the manner in which such mark, device, word or combination was put to use. Learned counsel supported his contention by citing case of Pakistan Energy House (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Rio Chemical Company and another (2003 CLD 1531).
 
","For the foregoing, this appeal is allowed and order of the learned trial Court dated 27-5-2005 is set aside, resultantly, the application for grant of temporary injunction, filed by. the respondent, is dismissed. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial at its own merit.
Before parting with the judgment it is clarified that any observation made herein is tentative and not final, yet inevitable.
 
Office is directed to send back the record of the trial Court.
 

","The appeal, in hand, is directed against the order whereby learned trial Court accepted the application of the plaintiff/respondent and granted the relief of temporary injunction. Comparison of trade mark of the appellant with trade mark of the respondent, at this stage, would unfairly prejudice the case of either party before the trial Court. It is yet inevitable to discuss whether or not, the trade mark registered in favour of the respondent, is being infringed or the trade mark used by the appellant is deceptive, earlier decision of this Court, passed in F.A.O. No.119 of 1986 (M/s Anwar Industries v. Muhammad Din and sons) is necessary. Relevant part of judgment is reproduced hereunder:--
 
'...Respondent 1's trade mark bearing the words 'Super Asia' has device of oval embellishment in yellow, black and red colours whereas the appellant's trade mark of 'Asia' has device of dental wheel and has different colour scheme. The goods covered by the two sets of trade marks are altogether different and belong to different classes. Respondent 1 has been using the trade mark 'Super Asia' since 1976 and doing quite a good amount of business. The two trade marks are not confusing and are distinguishable. In the circumstances the Registrar had valid reason to turn down the appellant's opposition....""
 
The above judgment/order had not been assailed, before the apex Court, it has attained finality. The decision being inter se the same parties, subject-matter was substantially the same and it was decided by the Court of competent jurisdiction, after hearing the parties. Such decision/judgment in a subsequent suit is binding. It was relevant and most apt for present controversy but was surprisingly ignored by the trial Court. The appellant though has not mentioned about it in written statement, yet has not taken any contrary plea. Above referred judgment of this Court was not taken a plea in defence. Mere non-mention of earlier litigation, in written statement creates no bar. A judgment of High Court is authority, in subsequent suit, which has to be considered and is not liable to be ignored. Article 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 can be referred in this respect. The impugned order of trial Court whereby earlier order dated 26-10-1986 has not been taken into consideration, is not legally sustainable.
In view of definite finding of this Court that respective trade marks of the parties herein, are altogether different, not confusing and distinguishable, leaves no room to conclude that the pre-requisite of injunction order i.e. prima facie case, was lacking.
 
A bare reading of section 13, clearly reveals that disclaimers are imposed for the purpose of defining the right, under the registration and not otherwise i.e. outside the registration. The proviso clearly provides that rights in a trade mark or a part of a trademark, arise, out of registration of which a disclaimer is made. Registrar at the time of granting of the registration, registered the trademark of the respondent subject to disclaimer, considering that it was not distinctive in favour of the proprietor. It is clear from the reading of section 13 .that the Registrar is empowered to place limitations by way of disclaimers on the rights which are granted to a party applying for registration of a trademark. Disclaimers are necessary to define the rights that a proprietor acquires by virtue of the registration. The disclaimer does not affect the proprietary rights acquired in the disclaimed feature by virtue of use and 'therefore the proprietor can prevent unauthorized use of disclaimed feature by proving prior use and acquisition of reputation and goodwill. One who opposes the exclusive rights of a proprietor in the disclaimed features of trademark, either arising out of a registration or through use must, establish a higher degree of honesty of adoption of that mark by him, absence of bad faith and that the said mark is not a mark itself but only a description of goods or services which is common to trade and should be for free of use by all the traders.
 
Section 6(1)(d) prohibits registration of a trademark comprising of a geographical name. Upon review of the Trade Marks Act as a whole, it becomes apparent that the Trade Marks Act in section 6, lays down the ""distinctiveness requisite for registration"". Therefore any trademark, which does not fulfil the requirements laid down in section 6 is not considered to be inherently distinctive and therefore not registerable. It was perhaps due to the fact that Registrar considered ""ASIA"" to be a geographical name, being the name of a continent, that it was not considered to be distinctive when it was registered and therefore a disclaimer on the exclusive use of the word 'ASIA' was imposed.
 
An important point, which cannot be ignored in these proceedings is that the respondent remained aware of the use of the trade mark 'Super Asia' by the appellant, since at least the year 1993 and they had already unsuccessfully opposed the registration of 'Super Asia' in favour of the appellant. Respondent's appeal before a learned Single Judge of this Court failed and they did not assail that decision before the apex Court. On the other hand, the legal proceedings, out of which this appeal has arisen, were instituted by the respondents against the appellant in the year 2004. There is an unexplained long delay of 11 years in instituting proceedings for infringement and/or passing off against the appellant. Such unexplained delay clearly tilts the balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable loss in favour of the appellant disentitling the respondent for the grant of discretionary relief of interlocutory injunction and these important aspects have been over-looked by the learned Court below.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICES ISSUED TO MESSRS OPTIONS INTERNATIONAL (SMC-PVT.) LIMITED ON COMPLAINT FILED BY MESSRS STARBUCKS CORPORATION, USA

"," In the matter of F. No. 282/STARBUCKS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 17th August, 2018.",,,"This order shall dispose of the application dated 01st August 2018 (the 'IO Application') filed by M/s. Starbucks Corporation of the United States of America (the 'Complainant') for interim relief filed under section 32 of the Competition Act 2010 (the 'Act') read with Regulation 25(3) of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulation 2007 (the 'GER').
In the instant matter, the Commission vide the Show Cause Notice (the 'SCN') dated 04th May 2018 issued to M/s. Options International (SMC-Pvt.) Limited (the 'Respondent') notified that there exists a prima facie case of contravention of sections 10(2)(d) and 10(2)(b) read with section 10(1) of the Act and called upon to show cause in writing within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt of the SCN and also to appear and place before the Commission the facts and material in support of its contentions either in person or through an authorized representative on 17th May 2018 at the office of the Commission and to explain why an appropriate order under section 31(1)(c) of the Act may not be passed and/or a penalty for the aforesaid violation may not be imposed under section 38 of the Act.
On 07th May 2018, a letter was received from the Complainant's counsel stating that they are unable to attend the Commission on 17th May 2018 because they are travelling abroad to attend an international conference, hence, requested to adjourn the hearing to another date. Acceding to the request of the Complainant an adjournment was granted.
Through the instant IO Application, the Complainant reiterated the contents of its Complaint that the Respondent is engaged in dissemination of false and misleading information/claims representing it an international corporation selling and serving ""Starbucks"" coffee and allied products in Pakistan; whereas, it has no authorization or license to use the Complainant's registered and well-known trademark ""Starbucks"" and the word mark ""Starbucks Coffee""; thereby, it is deliberately engaged in deceptive marketing practices to the Complainant's and the consumer's detriment in contravention of section 10 of the Act.
The Complainant has prayed that the Commission may pass an interim order under section 32 of the Act requiring the Respondent and the outlets owned and operated by the Respondent to refrain from deceptive marketing practices as explained in the Complaint in order to prevent further irreparable loss and damage to the business and goodwill of the Complainant till the conclusion of the proceedings in the subject complaint.
After considering the Complainant's I.O. Application, vide hearing notice dated 08th August 2018, the parties were informed that the I.O. Application shall be heard on 15th August 2018 and they are required to file their written submissions, if any, on the issue of interim relief under section 32 of the Act. However, no written submission was made by them. with a different defendant.","On 15th August 2018, the Complainant and the Respondent through their authorized representatives were heard on the I.O. Application. The submissions/contentions of the Complainant are outlined in brief as follows:
a) In its reply to the SCN dated 4th May 2018, the Respondent has admitted that it was imitating the products such as coffee cups of the Respondent and other coffee houses merely as souvenirs. However, citing the contents of the Enquiry Report, the Complainant asserted that it is an established fact that the Respondent has been marketing, advertising, producing and supplying coffee and other related products' labelling and packaging bearing Starbucks' trademark and logo without any authorization from the Complainant. Further, the Respondent was and continues to use the Complainant's trademark and labelling/packaging on its Facebook page in order to deceive the consumers.
b) The Complainant submitted that in the situation that exists or is likely to emerge, serious or irreparable damage may occur to the Complainant, hence it must be restrained to take any opportunity to ride on the back of the Starbucks brand to attract consumers.
","Till the issuance of the final Order and conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act under Show Cause Notice No. 14 of 2018, the Respondent is directed to refrain from marketing, advertising, producing and supplying coffee and other related products' labelling and packaging bearing Starbucks' trademark and logo anywhere which inter alia include the website and Facebook page, without any authorization from the Complainant; and
The Respondent is directed not to claim any association or affiliation with the Complainant or using the trademarks or logos of the Complainant on any of its marketing material, while selling any of its products, in particular coffee or other related products at any of its Restaurants/Cafes till the conclusion of the proceedings under Section 30 of the Act and until further Orders.
The Respondent is cautioned that in case any violation of the above said directions is committed, the Respondent in pursuance of clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 38 of the Act read with clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act, shall be liable to a fine of Rs.10,000,000/- (Rupees Ten Million Only). The Respondent is also directed to file the compliance report with reference to the directions given in Para 17 above within seven (7) days from the date of this Order with the Registrar of the Commission without fail.
Needless to say, the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and without prejudice to further proceedings in the instant matter.
In terms of the above, the I.O. Application stands allowed and the Registrar of the Commission is directed to transmit copies of this Order to the concerned parties and also to issue hearing notices to the parties concerned for 11th September, 2018






","The submissions/contentions of the Respondent are summarized as follows:
a) Since 04th April 2018, the Respondent cafe and bakery have been non-operational after the fire broke out on the aforesaid date. Thus, the Respondent is merely operating its restaurant but the cafe and bakery are closed and the Respondent is not serving coffee. 
In the attending circumstances and in pursuance of Regulation 52A of the GER, we deemed it appropriate to seek assistance from Mr. Noman A. Farooqi, Director General (Legal) of the Commission. In attendance and after the submissions of the authorized representatives of the Complainant and Respondent, for assistance of the bench, following submissions were made by him:
a) The Commission initiated the proceedings under section 30 of the Act after considering the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report dated 9th March 2018. The photographs in the Survey, which have not been denied by the Respondent clearly shows that the Respondent is using the Trademarks of the Complainant on its website, Facebook page, outside the Restaurant, inside the Restaurant, on the crockery as well as on the menu card.
b) As far as the claim of the Respondent that the cafe and bakery are closed since 4th April 2018, it was submitted that the Officer of the Commission Mr. Imran Akhter, Senior Assistant visited the premises of the Respondent on 10th August 2018 and the Restaurant was not only operational but coffee was also being served.
c)It was submitted that under section 32 of the Act, the Commission may in any proceedings under section 30 of the Act, (i) where final order is likely to take time, (ii) a situation exists or is likely to emerge, (iii) that situation may cause serious or irreparable damage, and (iv) an interim Order is necessary in the public interest, (v) after giving an opportunity of hearing, may pass an Order directing the undertaking concerned to do or refrain from doing or continuing to do any act or thing specified in the Order.
d) It is on the record that the Trademarks used by the Respondent are in fact registered in the name of the Complainant and the registration certificates are placed as 'Annexure-A' to the Enquiry Report. The Respondents have not placed any document on the record which shows that the trademarks `Starbucks' used by them is infact registered in their name. 
e) In another case reported as Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited v. United Insurance Company of Pakistan Limited, reported as 2016 CLD 1663, the honourable Sindh High Court held that
""...Considering the background of the Plaintiffs' business, it seems that adoption of the same trademark which is phonetically and visually similar and there is likelihood that it would create confusion and deception to the customers of such class...
In my view the defendants have failed to justify bona fide adoption of the word, ""Amaan Plan"" and/or ""Amaan"" as they may have other choices instead of plaintiff's registered mark which has already gained popularity and enjoying a goodwill in the market, hence, I am of the view that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, balance of inconvenience is also in their favour and they would suffer irreparable loss unless the application is allowed as prayed. Accordingly, application is allowed.""
After hearing the Parties we are of the view that the Act was promulgated with the scope to provide free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti-competitive behaviours. As is evident that the interim Order under section 32 of the Act can only be passed upon satisfaction of following conditions:
(i) Final Order in the proceedings is likely to take time,
(ii) A situation exists or is likely to emerge,
(iii) As a consequence of the above situation serious or irreparable damage may occur, and
(iv) Interim Order is necessary in the public interest,
(v) After providing an opportunity of hearing to the concerned undertakings.
we are of the opinion that the issuance of final order in the instant matter may take time, hence, the first condition under section 32 of the Act stands satisfied.
With reference to the second condition, a prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report along with the evidence are available on the record, which inter alia include the registration certificates and the images of the Restaurant and Cafe owned and operated by the Respondent, and the printouts of the Respondents' Facebook page are presented by the Complainant's Counsel showing that the Respondent is using the registered trademark of the Complainant. Thus, we are of the considered view that a, prima facie contravention of clauses (a), (b) and (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act is made out. In this regard we are in agreement with the judgments 2015 CLD 655 and 2016 CLD 1663.
Regarding the third condition, we are guided by the observations made in one of the earlier decisions of the Commission i.e. In the matter of Complaint filed by DHL reported as 2013 CLD 1014:
""It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant 's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents.""
Since, the Respondent is prima facie using the trademark of the Complainant and the trademarks are also registered in the name of the Complainant, proof whereof is placed on the record as an annexure to the Enquiry Report, allowing the Respondent to continue with the use of Complainant's trademark may cause serious or irreparable damage to the business and goodwill of the Complainant.
With reference to the fourth condition, we note that the Commission may issue an Interim Order under section 32 of the Act, where the issuance is in the public interest. Although the term ""public interest"" is not defined under the Act, however, we have taken guidance from the judgment of the honourable High Court in the case Nasrullah v. Province of Balochistan, reported as 2000 PLC (C.S.) 769, wherein the Honourable Court observed as follows:
""The word public interest has not been defined in the statute, therefore, to view of its definition in above quoted citation in our opinion in broader sense this expression can be defined which is action that can be taken to protect the legal rights of the general public or a class of public with whom justice is required to be done by a competent authority keeping in view the relevant rules and laws available on the subject. In this behalf it is also to be added that competent authority though enjoys jurisdiction to adjudge in view of the prevailing circumstance to do or not to do a particular act in the public interest but at the same time care should be taken that such act may not cause injustice to some or majority of the members of the public who are also entitled equally for protection of a law/rules under which action has been taken.""
As mentioned earlier, the Commission is entrusted with the role of protecting the consumers from anti-competitive behaviours which inter alia include the deceptive marketing practices being prohibited under Section 10 of the Act. Further, the Commission is right in its steed to restrain the undertakings from resorting to unfair competitive practice such like using someone else's trademark and that too a registered trademark without any authorization or license, which may not only harm the business interest of the owner of trade mark but will also deceive the consumers in making them believe that the products which they have purchased belonged to or is associated with the owner of trademark, which in fact is not the case. Hence, we are of the considered view that the fourth condition also stands satisfied in the instant matter.",HBT/9/CCOP Application allowed.,Allowed.

Versus
The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 64 of 2017, decided on 12th January, 2018.","27th November, 2017","MRS. ASHRAF JAHAN, J.","The facts leading to the present appeal as per case of the Appellant are that they are proprietor of ""Moonlite Trading Company"", (hereinafter referred to as (""the Appellant Company""), which is a merchant, importer and marketer of self-designed consumer goods and other items. Since last several decades the Appellant Company is carrying the business of merchant and import of consumer goods including lotions, toiletries, perfumes, deodorants, air-fresheners, diapers and insecticides in Pakistan. The products imported by the Appellant Company are being marketed and sold under various Trade Marks, which include Cobra, Lotion Cobra, Soft Touch, Ku Ku, Lotion Saffire, Mascot, etc. They have also developed distinctive designs, logos or artwork for use in connection with the aforesaid brands including Appellant's current and long standing Trade Mark ""COBRA"". Therefore, in its pursuance, the Appellant Company obtained registration of the Trade Mark ""COBRA"" under Registration No.99323 in international class 05 since 11.08.1988 under the Ordinance, 2001, which registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes till today. In order to further strengthen its proprietorship, the Appellant either directly or through their company has also secured copyright registration under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962. The Appellant's product bearing ""COBRA"" has been and continued to be sold and promoted extensively throughout Pakistan since year 1988 without any hindrance from any quarter and thus they had invested substantial amount in the promotion and publicity of the product bearing ""COBRA"" mark and therefore, the Appellant company enjoys an enviable reputation and goodwill in the said Trade Mark in Pakistan.
It is further the case of the Appellant that on or about 31.03.2010, Respondent No.2 applied for the Registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", which was accepted for publication in the Trade Mark Journal in order to invite Opposition and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 733 in the month of February, 2012. Immediately upon becoming aware of such publication, the Appellant filed a Notice of Opposition bearing Opposition No.455/2013 against the grant of Registration of Mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" on the ground, inter alia, that the Trade Mark applied for is identical to the Appellant's trade mark ""COBRA"" and is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the consumers. In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Opposition, Respondent No.2 filed its counter statement contending that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was adopted in 2009 in order to distinguish its goods from other competitors and Notice of Opposition is liable to be dismissed on the ground that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is quite distinguishable from the Appellant's mark ""COBRA"", thus, qualifies for registration.
Subsequently, in January, 2014 it came to the Appellant's knowledge that Respondent No.2 in connivance with others had commenced their illegal activities of importing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and selling their goods in Karachi under the name and style of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", therefore, immediately upon becoming aware of such illegal activities, the Appellant filed Suit No.192/2014 against Respondent No.2 for infringement of rights, passing off, unfair competition, declaration and permanent injunction. In these proceedings vide order dated 03.02.2014 interim injunction was also passed, restraining Respondent No.2 from using mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". During the pendency of above suit and proceedings in Opposition No.455/2013, Appellant came to know that Respondent No.2 in the present appeal illegally obtained Trade Mark Registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", thereafter a detailed order was passed on 06.06.2014 in Suit No.192/2014, whereby the Appellant was required to file an application for invalidation of registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". Meanwhile, Respondent No.2 filed H.C.A. No.220/2014 against the order dated 06.06.2014 passed by the Single Bench in Suit No.192/2014 and the said order of Single Judge was suspended by the Division Bench vide its order dated 25.09.2014. The appeal was dismissed and the matter was remanded to the learned Single Judge to decide the injunction application in Suit No.192/2014. On 13.03.2017, an order was passed, whereby the registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was held as null and void and Respondent No.1 was directed to proceed with Opposition No.455/2013 and to pass a speaking order within thirty days. As a result thereof, the cancellation of the illegal registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing application No.280917 in class 5 was confirmed in Trade Marks Journal No.794 dated 01.03.2017. Opposition No.455/2013 came up for final hearing on 04.05.2017 before Respondent No.1 and subsequently on 10.08.2017 short order dated 07.08.2017 was communicated to the Appellant, disallowing the Opposition of the Appellant and allowing the application bearing No.280917 in class 5 of Respondent No.2 to proceed with registration with the disclaimer of word ""Cobra"" and all descriptive words/letters/device appearing on the label.
As the above order was received to the Appellant on 10.08.2017, they applied for certified copy of the decision, but the same was not communicated, hence they filed appeal only on the basis of short order communicated to them. However, subsequently, in compliance of Court's order dated 20.11.2017 detailed order was supplied to the parties, which is impugned by way of present appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed Counter Affidavit to this appeal and denied all the allegations/averments/statements made in the memorandum of titled appeal and supported the impugned order.
 with an additional plaintiff.","It is contended by learned counsel for the Appellant that the impugned order has been passed, ignoring the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the provisions of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; in particular section 17 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been wrongly applied by Respondent No.1 while passing the order. Per learned counsel, the product bearing mark ""COBRA"" continued to be in use in Pakistan by the present Appellant since 1987 and the Appellant is the proprietor of the mark ""COBRA"" bearing Registration Nos.99323 and 106208 in classes 5 and 16 respectively; the earliest registration was obtained in the year 1988. The Respondent No.1 for arriving at the decision in respect of Opposition No.455/2013 has ignored and misconstrued the orders dated 13.02.2017, 20.02.2017 and 13.03.2017 passed by this Court in J.M. No.34/2014, wherein learned Judge clearly observed in the order that the trade mark registration was nearly identical, therefore, was in violation of the trade mark laws. This being the position, impugned decision passed by Respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
On the other hand, it is contended by learned counsel for Respondent No.2 that Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of import and for its products of insecticides had used trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", since year 2009. Per learned counsel, the Respondent's products under the Ordinance, 2001 referred to above are sold in Pakistan since 2009 onwards and expenditure of millions of rupees is incurred upon the advertisement of such products and it was well in knowledge of the Appellant since 2009, but they remained silent; neither objected nor otherwise filed any suit to restrain Respondent No.2 from using trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" and it is only in the month of February, 2014 after a delay of almost five years, they filed Suit No.192/2014 and obtained ex parte ad-interim injunction order in the suit, whereby Respondent No.2 was restrained from using its proprietor trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"".",For the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of Respondent No.1 is set aside and the Opposition No.455/2013 filed by the appellant is allowed. The application of Respondent No.2 bearing No.280917 is rejected.,"It is contended by learned counsel that the word ""COBRA"" per se is descriptive, suggestive and common to trade in relation to insecticides and herbicides; therefore, provisions of section 17 subject to provision of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001 are not applicable to the present case. They have got only registered their label and have not obtained any registration for the word ""COBRA"". Presently a larger number of competitors of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 are selling their insect killing products in various parts of the world including Pakistan using descriptive, suggestive and common to trade word ""COBRA"" and no confusion and deception has been caused to any person, therefore, in the light of above factual and legal position, Respondent No.1 has rightly passed the order, which has been impugned before this Court with wrong perception and ulterior motives. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following case law:
2013 CLD 330 (Tillotts Pharma AG v. GETZ Pharma (Private) Limited.)
1989 SCMR 361 (Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd.)
2007 CLD 991 (Messrs Master Textile Mills Ltd. v. Master Fabrics)
2007 CLD 997 (Abid Aziz Khan and 2 others v. Bank of Punjab).
Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 submitted that the order passed by Respondent No.1 has been passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the impugned order is valid and needs no interference at this stage.
Reasoning and Analysis
I have considered the arguments advanced before me by both the sides and have perused the case record.
To commence with, the material placed on record shows that so far as the claim of the Appellant as regards registration of trade mark ""COBRA"" and its prior use, disclosed in paragraphs two to five of the memo of appeal is concerned, it is an undeniable reality established on record; therefore, it needs no further discussion. Moreover, from the contents of earlier order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34/2014 it is also established that earlier certificate for registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing No.138268 dated 24.02.2014 in relation to trade mark No.280917 was issued by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 in blatant violation of the scheme of trade mark laws and thus declared null and void, which position was conceded before the Court by Respondent No.1 and not much disputed by Respondent No.2. In this background now it is to be seen that how far the subsequent impugned order dated 07.08.2017 passed by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 once again affirming the earlier stance (reasons recorded on 20.09.2017) is legal and within the frame work of the Ordinance, 2001. In this context firstly it is to be noted that purported prior use of trade mark ""COBRA"" by Respondent No.2 on the strength of earlier order of Respondent No.1, which was set aside by this Court vide order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34 of 2014 was nullity and void thus such period could not be considered by the Respondent No.1 as valid ground to justify the subsequent impugned order; observations of Respondent No.1 for this purpose are therefore ill-founded and perverse. Based on these facts there is no difficulty for me to hold that on one side the claim of Appellant regarding registration and use of trade mark ""COBRA"" is fully established and on the other side the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in the same category of goods is on weak footings, unless the Respondent No.2 could satisfy that use of prefix 'faster black' in their label before ""COBRA"" is sufficient to dislodge the opposition No.455 of 2013 filed by the Appellant. I have called for the samples of both the respective products from the learned counsel for the appellant and Respondent No.2 and by placing them in juxtaposition carefully examined the same, with reference to labels of ""COBRA"" and ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", and also the package material, size, shape, colour scheme and overall printed text. For ready reference their picture is placed below, which depicts similarities in the two products, sufficient to cause confusion among the ordinary customers.
The main guiding principle to examine the genuineness of the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for the registration of its trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is that upon comparison of the two, the Court is to be satisfied that there are sufficient features to differentiate between the two trade marks phonetically as well as visually, so that an unwary buyer of the same product, as in the instant matter, is genuinely not confused and misguided due to the feature of similarities between the two. In my considered opinion, the concept of totality of impression, test of average consumer etc. recorded by the Respondent No.1 in its order dated 20.09.2017 is misconceived and erroneous. As observed by me there are sound reasons disclosed by the Appellant in his Opposition No.455/2013, which justify grant of such opposition and consequent rejection of Application of 280917 in class 5 of registration of Trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in favour of Respondent No.2. This view of the matter is supported from the following judgments of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which are of binding nature:
PLD 1984 Supreme Court 8 (Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another).
PLD 1990 Supreme Court 313 (Seven-Up Company v. Kohinoor Thread Ball Factory and 3 others).

","File No. 274/FEROZSONS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 24th September, 2018.","22nd May, 2018.",nil,"The Complainant is a public limited company registered under the law of Pakistan, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing, importing, packaging and selling certain medicinal/ pharmaceutical products across Pakistan. As is submitted in the Complaint, the Complainant is the sole distributor and right holder in Pakistan of a complete range of products sold under the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"", registered with The Trade Marks Registry in Karachi, Pakistan bearing trademark No. 179961 dated 28 August 2002 in class 5 for analgesic (pain relieving) pharmaceutical preparations. The products are sold in the form of spray, gel, and roll-on of different specifications bearing distinctive getup and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising predominantly of green and light blue coloured text and white background. Furthermore, it was submitted that the Complainant is enlisted with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) as the authorized importer and distributor of pharmaceutical products branded as ""BIOFREEZE"". The Complainant averred that the Respondent was fraudulently using similar, deceptive or confusingly similar mark ""BYQFREEZ"" in relation to similar pharmaceutical preparations in the form of spray and gel so as to pass off them as and for the products of the Complainant, which tantamount deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
4. The Enquiry Report examined whether the Respondent has contravened the provisions of section 10 of the Act. It was found that the Complainant is the authorized importer/distributor of ""BIO/FREEZE"" branded product line. Whereas the Respondent was engaged in the manufacture and sale of products branded as ""BYQFREEZ"" which were deceptively similar viz., phonetic similarity with the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" bearing highly similar label/design/colour to the unique, distinctive label/design/colour scheme with the Complainant's products. The Enquiry Report concluded that the Respondent's unauthorized and dishonest adoption of deceptively and/or confusingly similar trademark appears to be fraudulent use of trademark and labelling and packaging in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act. Furthermore, it was concluded that the Respondent appears to be disseminating false and misleading information, including its substantially lower pricing in the market to the detriment of consumers and competitors in contravention of clause (b) and clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.  in a different city.","In view of the submissions made by the parties in the subject proceedings, following issues merit deliberation:
i. Whether the Complainant's claim qua the trademark 'BIOFREEZE' and associated trade dress is valid for the purposes of section 10 of the Act?
ii. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clauses (d), (b) and (a) of subsection (2) read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act?
","the Complainant has made out its case that it is registered and authorized right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress in this case.
34. The Respondent, its proprietors, partners, directors, associates, agents, dealers, among others, are hereby restrained from using the impugned marks ""BYQFREEZ"" or any other mark with any prefix or suffix and trade dress that is phonetically, visually and constructively similar as that of the Complainant mark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress.
The Respondent has undertaken before the Bench that it will not repeat the contravention and comply with the provisions of section 10 of the Act. We, therefore, are inclined to take a lenient view and imposes penalty in the amount of PKR 2,500,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Hundred Thousand Only) pursuant to Section 38 of the Act on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is further directed to file, within sixty (60) days from the date of this order, a compliance report with reference to withdrawal of the products under the mark ""BYQFREEZ"" and stop using the said mark.
In case of non-compliance with the directions contained in Paras 34 and 35 ibid. of this order, the Respondent shall be further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to PKR 100,000 (Rupees one hundred thousand) per day from the date of this order.
38. In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.
","Before proceeding with the factual analysis, we would like to highlight and briefly explain the scope and objective of section 10 of the Act, which reads as follows:
'10. Deceptive marketing practices.---(1) No undertaking shall enter into deceptive marketing practices.
(2) The deceptive marketing practices shall be deemed to have been resorted to or continued of an Undertaking resorts to-
(a) the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking;
(b) the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods;
(c) [....]
(d) fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling and packaging.
Section 10 applies to all undertakings in Pakistan, regardless of their size and the way in which they are established or financed. The provisions of section 10 mandate the Commission to eliminate all causes of consumer deception or deceptive marketing practices. For deception to occur, there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumers. Second, the Commission examines the representation, omission or practice (collectively, ""practice"") from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. Reasonable is examined from the perspective of the ordinary consumer of the target group. Third, the representation, omission, or practice must be a ""material"" one. That is to say, whether the practice is likely to affect the consumer's conduct in terms of its purchasing decision viz., products or services. Advertising statements, disclosures, disclaimers or point of sale representations, inter alia, are the points where consumer first contacts between a seller and buyers. Whether or not a consumer buys a product is immaterial. The law may still be violated. Thus, a practice is material, there is the likelihood of consumer deception because it is presumed that the consumer might have chosen differently or made a different purchasing decision but for deception.
Keeping in view the alleged contravention, we are not concerned with the ""subjective intention"" but with the ""objective manifestation"" of intent to examine the concept of ""fraudulent use"". The prohibition, under clause (d) subsection (2) of section 10, applies to all forms of marks, including words, numbers, logos, pictures given that they function as source-identifier of a good or service.
Moreover, the application of the above clause does not differentiate between a registered and an unregistered mark. Nevertheless, with registration, a right holders' array of options for dealing with the unauthorized or fraudulent use of a trademark or trade dress is likely to increase. The registered trademarks, firm name or labelling and packaging are presumed to be valid and incontestable. Most importantly, they are used as apparatus to seek remedy against imitators claiming unawareness of the registration. By virtue of section 10, the legislature have, therefore, intended to protect consumers and trademark (and other commercial signs e.g., trade dress, symbols, colours or colour scheme, product shapes and product packaging and marketing themes, etc.) proprietors to be deprived of the property at the instance of business undertakings whose use is unauthorized and fraudulent.
It transpires from the record that M/s Performance Health, USA already had registered its trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" in 2002 in Pakistan and has successfully renewed it for a further period of ten years from 28 August 2009. Since its registration M/s. Performance Health have been commercially exploiting its trademark by way of export, distribution, marketing and sale of ""BIOFREEZE"" labelled products in Pakistan. At present, the Complainant is the sole licensor and authorized distributor of ""BIOFREEZE"" products of M/s Health Performance in Pakistan. Therefore, we are convinced that registration of the Trademark ""BIOFREEZ"" in favour of the Complainant is valid. Consequently, the Complainant, holds valid right to initiate action(s) against the imitators of its trademark and labelling and packaging under clause (d), subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.

In the Complaint as well as the Enquiry Report concluded that prima facie the Respondent has violated section 10 of the Act that is designated to protect consumers against unfair, deceptive, fraudulent trade and business practices and false advertising. In its previous decisions, the Commission has underscored certain key principles to assess the fraudulent use of another's trademark, misleading and deceptive labelling and packaging, and advertising, among other things. The following paragraphs briefly highlight the principles laid down under clause (d) subsection (2) section 10 of read with subsection (1) section 10 of the Act.
16. The Commission in one of its earlier Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of M/s. A. Rahim Food Pvt. Limited reported as 2016 CLD 1128, observed that ""parasitic copying"" (Look-alikes) of trademark and trade dress of a brand are inherent in all cases of ""fraudulent"" use of another's trademark, firm name, labelling, and packaging' and has laid down the following standards:
'a) It is now well-established principle under the majority of regulatory competition regimes around the world that mimicking the packaging design of familiar established brands is a misleading and deceptive ploy with the end purpose of boosting sales.
b) Such purpose or object of parasitic copycat packaging is driven [...] from [...] the perspective of the consumer. A potential purchaser is much more likely to mistake and perceive products which employ parasitic copying to be of better quality than they in fact are or as equivalent to the aggrieved competitor or market leader (whose packaging has been copied). Hence, a consumer is more likely to purchase such a product, rather than if the packaging was clearly distinctive and distinguishable.
c) The end result of such a practice is that the consumer is misled by the ""copycat"" who is fraudulently attempting to pass off its products as something else. Furthermore, the copycat incurs the minimal cost and in fact none of the cost of investment and innovation of a design that the market leader has spent to build goodwill and reputation of its brand assets in the relevant market. Hence, where product differentiation is insufficient, such a practice on the part of the copycat has fatal consequences for the business of the market leader.
d) In furtherance to the interpretation of the term ""fraudulent use [of another's trademark] "" of ""product labelling and packaging"" within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, it may be noted that fraud itself consists of some deceitful practice or wilful device to obtain an unjust advantage and which deprives another of right or causes another injury. The Commission, entrusted with the task of adjudicating upon a potential contravention under the Act, remains of the much wider context and purpose of the said prohibition. The Commission shall therefore, be satisfied that the evidence adduced before it is conclusive, if the strikingly similar packaging and labelling is misleading enough to cause confusion in the minds of average consumer of a commodity, with the end result of unjust advantage accruing to the copycat at the expense of and to the detriment of the complainant.
e) The Commission deems it appropriate to examine the packaging and product labelling appearance of a finished product as a whole which may collectively include visually confusing resemblance in elements of colour scheme, layout style, design, images, labels, font usage etc., instead of each individual similarity, in isolation, to come to its determination as to the contravention under section 10(2)(d) of the Act. It may also be noted that the Commission takes into account the surrounding circumstances which may be different in each particular case, as being peculiar to the parties, products, consumers and the relevant market.
f) Lastly, it may be noted that the worldwide consumer survey-based consensus is that when copycat packaging is developed for a particular commodity, price becomes the main and sometimes only criterion which affects a consumer's choice of purchase. Furthermore, when price becomes the sole determining factor for the exercise of choice between two products with no other meaningful distinguishing factor existing between such products, it is evidence of the presence of parasitic copying.
In the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. Shainal Al-Syed Foods dated 30th March 2018, referring to the judgment of Delhi High Court, reported as Colgate Palmolive Co. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care (Pvt.) Limited (2003) PTC 478 Del, wherein Colgate sought [...] to restrain Anchor Health's use of the trade dress and colour combination of red and white in relation to identical products i.e. tooth powder, even though the latter's trademark/tradename was completely different, the Court held that:
'52. It is overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, shape of the container, packaging etc.'
...
'If the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, get-up and layout appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one's own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter'.
Now keeping in view the parties' conduct and submissions before us, the facts scenarios in the instant case may be summarized as follows:
(i) The Complainant has claimed to be the registered proprietor of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and has stated to have adopted the trademark in respect of certain analgesic harmaceutical preparations and is distributing/selling in Pakistan since at least 2004. Furthermore, the Complainant has claimed to be the proprietor of the trade dress, which includes the containers and labels (comprising predominantly green and light blue colours with white background) of the products. The Complainant has submitted that on account of the efficacy and rigorous marketing the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"" and its unique trade dress have accumulated immense goodwill and international reputation including in Pakistan amongst the relevant members of trade as well as the public-at-large. Against this backdrop, the Complainant has alleged that by use of identical or deceptively similar trademark such as ""BYQFREEZ"" by the Respondent and appropriating or adopting prominently similar trade dress in terms of bottling, layout, get up and colour combination with obvious intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and deceive consumers, the Respondent has acted in contravention of section 10 of the Act.
(ii) The Respondent, on the other hand, has denied the allegations of passing off and deceptive marketing practices. In support of its case, the Respondent has contended that the two marks i.e. ""BIOFREEZE"" and ""BYQFREEZ HPRR"" are not identical. Furthermore, the Respondent has submitted that the ingredients of the Respondent's product are much different than the Complainants'. On 21.9.2017, the Complainant has deposed that between 2003 and 2014 it was the sole distributor of M/s. Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" product line in Pakistan. However, its distributorship was terminated in early 2014 because it failed to achieve its sales targets. Thereafter, the Respondent adopted ""Neucon Pakistan"" as its new business name. According to the Respondent, when it was intimated that the Complainant is the new authorized licensee/distributor of M/s Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" products in Pakistan, it launched its own brand ""BIOFREEZ HPQR"" for similar products i.e. analgesic pharmaceutical preparations. Currently, the Respondent has four distributors in Pakistan and its products are sold to the masses at pharmacies.
In view of the above, the we are of the considered opinion that the Complainant has proved beyond doubt that it is the registered proprietor and right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" as well as the trade dress i.e. green and light blue labelling and packaging of the products in question. Hence it has the exclusive right to use the trademark including trade dress of ""BIOFREEZE"". By adoption of an identical trademark i.e. ""BYQFREEZ"" and the trade dress - the overall getup, the Respondent has contravened clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
26. The Commission also finds that it is highly likely that the consumers would be deceived/misled by false and misleading depictions of the Respondent which constitutes a contravention of section 10(2)(b) read with section 10(1) of the Act. The Commission further finds that by resorting to the aforesaid practices the Respondent has failed to fulfil its obligation to avoid unfair competition and become unjustly rich by encashing on the goodwill or reputation of the Complainant, hence in violation of section 10(2)(a) read with section 10(1) of the Act.

","File No. 274/FEROZSONS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 24th September, 2018.","22nd May, 2018.",nil,"The Complainant is a public limited company registered under the law of Pakistan, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing, importing, packaging and selling certain medicinal/ pharmaceutical products across Pakistan. As is submitted in the Complaint, the Complainant is the sole distributor and right holder in Pakistan of a complete range of products sold under the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"", registered with The Trade Marks Registry in Karachi, Pakistan bearing trademark No. 179961 dated 28 August 2002 in class 5 for analgesic (pain relieving) pharmaceutical preparations. The products are sold in the form of spray, gel, and roll-on of different specifications bearing distinctive getup and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising predominantly of green and light blue coloured text and white background. Furthermore, it was submitted that the Complainant is enlisted with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) as the authorized importer and distributor of pharmaceutical products branded as ""BIOFREEZE"". The Complainant averred that the Respondent was fraudulently using similar, deceptive or confusingly similar mark ""BYQFREEZ"" in relation to similar pharmaceutical preparations in the form of spray and gel so as to pass off them as and for the products of the Complainant, which tantamount deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
4. The Enquiry Report examined whether the Respondent has contravened the provisions of section 10 of the Act. It was found that the Complainant is the authorized importer/distributor of ""BIO/FREEZE"" branded product line. Whereas the Respondent was engaged in the manufacture and sale of products branded as ""BYQFREEZ"" which were deceptively similar viz., phonetic similarity with the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" bearing highly similar label/design/colour to the unique, distinctive label/design/colour scheme with the Complainant's products. The Enquiry Report concluded that the Respondent's unauthorized and dishonest adoption of deceptively and/or confusingly similar trademark appears to be fraudulent use of trademark and labelling and packaging in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act. Furthermore, it was concluded that the Respondent appears to be disseminating false and misleading information, including its substantially lower pricing in the market to the detriment of consumers and competitors in contravention of clause (b) and clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.  due to a change in law.","In view of the submissions made by the parties in the subject proceedings, following issues merit deliberation:
i. Whether the Complainant's claim qua the trademark 'BIOFREEZE' and associated trade dress is valid for the purposes of section 10 of the Act?
ii. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clauses (d), (b) and (a) of subsection (2) read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act?
","the Complainant has made out its case that it is registered and authorized right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress in this case.
34. The Respondent, its proprietors, partners, directors, associates, agents, dealers, among others, are hereby restrained from using the impugned marks ""BYQFREEZ"" or any other mark with any prefix or suffix and trade dress that is phonetically, visually and constructively similar as that of the Complainant mark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress.
The Respondent has undertaken before the Bench that it will not repeat the contravention and comply with the provisions of section 10 of the Act. We, therefore, are inclined to take a lenient view and imposes penalty in the amount of PKR 2,500,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Hundred Thousand Only) pursuant to Section 38 of the Act on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.

In support of her contention, the learned counsel has relied upon the case of Alpha Sewing Machine v: Registrar of Trade Marks reported in PLD 1990 SC Page 1074. 'The learned counsel has submitted that the Honourable Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has held that if there is element of deception or confusion then any such element in respect of nature of business the registered trademark cannot be used by the other party.
 
As against this the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has submitted that the defendants have not undertaken any manufacturing business, but are publishing newspaper which is distinct business and law does not restrict them from using such name. He further submits that the defendants have been granted declaration by the Federal Government to publish daily ""DEWAN"" and this declaration has been endorsed by the DCO, City District Government, Karachi. He therefore, submits irrespective of the registered trademark (DEWAN) of the plaintiff, they can undertake the business of publication in the lame of daily 'Dewan'.
","Under these circumstances I am of the considered view that the plaintiff prima facie had made out a case for grant of .injunction and allowing to use the trade mark ""DEWAN"" by the defendants would cause inconvenience and would lead to deception and confusion in terms of the provision of section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. The balance of convenience also rests with the plaintiff for the purpose of granting of injunction, I therefore, allow this injunction application, restraining the defendants from using the trade name/trademark word DEWAN "" "" in their publication.
 
","Class 16 of the International Classification of goods and services clearly provides that if trademark is registered the same cannot be used by any other person in the face of the provision of section 40(4) read with section 17 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Mere granting of declaration under the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance 2002 does not authorise the defendants to infringe, the right of the plaintiff guaranteed under the provision of the registered. Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The scope of granting of declaration is independent of the provision of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. Grant of declaration sloes not give rise to a party a right to use the registered trade mark of another party under the garb of distinct nature of business. The learned counsel for the defendant has failed to cite any case-law in support of his contention to show that publication of the newspaper under the provision of Press Council of. Pakistan Ordinance, 2002 on the basis of a declaration does not excludes the right of .infringement of the plaintiff under the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001.
 
The contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff appeals to reason. Once a trade mark/trade is registered under the provision of Trade Mark Ordinance 2001 then it restricts the other party from using such trademark. Moreso when it is g distinct and use of it would lead to confusion or deception. The agreement, of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is weighty and the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court on the issue also supports the case in hand.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE ISSUED TO MESSRS SOCIETY OF ACCOUNTING EDUCATION FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:
"," In the matter of
File No. 185/OFT/CFA/CCP/2015, decided on 14th December, 2016.",,,"The Complainant is a non-stock corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, United States of America. The company is engaged in imparting education and training to students and professionals in the field of investment and financial analysis and has gradually extended its operations around the world, including Pakistan. The Respondent is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 of Pakistan and is engaged in the provision of educational services in the field of finance and accounting. Both are undertaking in terms of section 2(1)(q) of the Act.
3. The Complainant has alleged that the Respondent has been using the Complainant's registered Trademark 'CFA' to deceive public and promote its business. It further alleged that the Respondent had resorted to the dissemination of false or misleading information, which is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant. Moreover, it alleged that the Respondent had been distributing false or misleading information by unauthorized use of imitated marks as CFA, ACFA, FCFA, DCFA, as if the Respondent was authorized/permitted by the Complainant to use the mark 'CFA' by the Complainant as such.
4. An enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated in the matter, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 04 March 2015 (the 'Enquiry Report').
After considering the Enquiry Report, the Commission issued the SCN to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before Commission on 02 June 2015. The relevant parts of the SCN are reproduced hereinbelow:
""AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, it appears that the Undertaking began using the Impugned Mark, and variations of it, in relation to its own educational enterprise in 2010, without the Complainant's authorization;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 19 in particular, the Complainant sent the Undertaking cease and desist letters in February 2011, in response to which the Respondent modified its website and eliminated references to be Impugned Mark for a certain time period;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, the Undertaking resumed its use of the Impugned Mark and its variations in 2012 which continued until the time of the complaint in 2013;
8. AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 6, 22 and 23 in particular, while it appears that the Undertaking has now modified the mark depicted on its website, it remains misleadingly similar to the Impugned Mark;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that through the use of the Impugned Mark and deceptively similar variations of the same, the Undertaking is prima facie distributing false and misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, the Undertaking is involved in providing and advertising its services through the use of the Impugned Mark which prima facie amounts to distributing false and misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods, which constitutes a prima facie violation of section 10(2)(b) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that the Undertaking's use of the Complainant's Impugned Mark prima facie amounts to fraudulent use of another's trademark, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act.""
 under different legal circumstances.","The following issues have been identified for deliberation and decision:
a) Whether or not the presence of a suit for permanent injunction against infringement of trademarks bars the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Act and hence the proceedings?
b) Whether or not the alleged advertisements, marketing material, and trademarks used by the Respondent constitute deceptive marketing practices in terms of section 10 of the Act?
","The Commission hereby directs the Respondent to immediately cease the use of the mark 'CFA' in any form whatsoever.
The Respondent is further directed to cease the use of terms 'DCFA, ACFA, FCFA, and CFAs.' or any other similar acronyms and terms, in any form and to amend its promotional and marketing material accordingly.
Furthermore, the Respondent is directed to amend its Article and Memorandum of Association to remove any reference to the abovementioned terms.
For each of the four violations stated above, a penalty of PKR 0.5 million is imposed on the Respondent for a total of PKR 2 million.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar to the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order and is reprimanded from indulging in deceptive marketing practices in future as at the risk of severe penal consequences.
The penalties and direction hereinabove have been imposed after taking into account the seriousness and length of the violations and its impact on the consumers and the interests of the competing undertakings, and are proportionate to the contraventions of section 10 of the Act and necessary to restore the fair competition in the relevant market.
In terms of the above, SCN No.01/2015 is hereby disposed of.

","With respect to the first issue, it is clarified that the subject proceedings before the Commission do not have any nexus with the suit proceedings pending before the learned Additional District and Session Judge as highlighted by the Respondent. It has been observed by Commission in its Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to M/s. Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for Deceptive Marketing Practices that the pendency of a civil suit or principle of ""res sub judice"" as enunciated in section 10 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (the 'C.P.C.') has no relevance to Commission's proceedings under the Act. The relevant part of the order is as follow:
""Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of 'res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision, as explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits' pending in 'courts'.
Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi- judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'court' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court.""
Based on the above, a suit for a permanent injunction regarding infringement of trademarks is a different subject than the one being considered by the Commission i.e. whether or not the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the Complainants trademark for the purpose of misleading consumers and distorting competition.

With respect to the second issue the Complainant has submitted documentary evidence of its 'applications of registration' and 'registration of Trade Mark' in the Trademark under TR No's. 196401, 196402, 136436 and 964000 which establishes the Complainant's exclusive right to mark CFA denoting Chartered Financial Analyst. The Respondent has used different advertising schemes by using the mark CFA for the promotion of its institute/courses, which has never been contested by the Respondent, both during the enquiry and the proceedings.
The Commission directed the Respondent in hearing on 2 June 2015 to submit its Memorandum and Article of Association. Upon analyzing the Memorandum and Article of Association. the following references relevant to the matter at hand were found:
a. The clause (i) of section 4 of Memorandum of Association of the Respondent states, ""the Society will award the membership as Certified Financial Accountants (CFA) and its associates and fellowship"".
b. The interpretation clause (1) of section 1 of Article of Association states, ""Profession means the profession of the business of Certified Financial Accountants (CFA)"".
19. It is also pertinent to mention here that Respondent on receiving the cease and desist letters on 21 March 2011 from Complainant, changed the designatory letters from CFA to CFAc in August 2013 for its Certified Financial Accountants program.
20. The above claims and the evidence available on the record clearly establish that the Respondent used the registered trademark of the Complainant i.e., CFA in its marketing and other materials. The images retrieved from the Respondent's website, the advertisements in newspapers, the evidence or record substantiate Complainant's assertions.
With regard to contravention of Section 10 of the Act, it is noted that the Commission in its Order In The Matter Of Show Cause Notices Issued to Paint Manufacturers (Taint Order') has observed that:
""...for the purposes of deceptive Marketing, actual deception need not be shown to carry the burden of proof it is sufficient to establish that the advertisement has the tendency to deceive and capacity to mislead.""
Furthermore, the Commission has observed in its Order In The Matter Of Complaint filed by Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd.
""It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely effect goodwill will and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant 's business interest...""
For the above reasons, in order to constitute a violation of section 10, the marketing and advertising must have the ability to deceive. 
Furthermore, in relation to section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the principle, the Commission has established the fraudulent use is not the ""subjective intent"" but the ""objective manifestation"" of that intent. 
In view of the above, the usage of the Complaints trademark 'CFA' amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information by the Respondent capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act. At the same time, as discussed above, the usage of the trademark also amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information to consumers in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(b) of the Act.
The marks used by the Respondent FCFA, DCFA, ACFA and CFAc, containing the words ""F"", ""D"", ""A"" and ""Ac"" stand respectively for Fellow, Diploma, Associate, and Accountants. Therefore the words ""F"", ""D"" and ""A"" used in the Complainant's trademark 'CFA' connote the idea that these courses are offered by the Complainant. An ordinary consumer i.e., the students of accounting and finance who would join the world renowned institute of complainant i.e., CFA, would likely be misled by these words and connotations and is highly likely to consider the Respondents institute as authorized by the Complainant. This is based on fact and the Commission's earlier decisions quoted above that the ordinary consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyze it minutely. In similar vein, the use of the letter `c' in minuscule Form with the registered trademark of the Complainant is capable of misleading the ordinary consumer.
In view of the above, the Commission holds that by using the above-noted variation of the 'CFA' the Respondent has violated section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

MUHAMMAD FAHIM---Respondent

","H.C.A. No. 269 of 2014, decided on 3rd May, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Brief facts of the case are that the appellant manufactures and sells syrup under the coined name Rooh Afza for decades and have had the said trademark registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (the 1940 Act) in the British India on 03.08.1942 in class 32. Various versions of the said trademark have been regularly registered by the appellant and from the details provided, we note that about eight registration between years 1961 upto 1984 have been sought by the appellant in respect of the said trademark giving rise to contention that the appellant is very alert in respect of protection and enforcement of its rights in the said trademark. Being a household name used for over a half century, the said trademark has acquired extreme popularity, which also attracts new incumbents to disguise their trademarks and trade-dress similar or confusingly similar to that of the appellant. The appellant's counsel contended that the Appellant became aware of the respondent's intended use of its trademark on 29.06.2014 when the latter advertised its products in the daily Dawn newspaper. Being alerted with the deceptive name and confusing similarities in the label used by the respondent, it was clear that the respondent intended to deceive the customers of the appellant and to take benefit of the hard earned reputation and market space created by the appellant for over 73 years; the appellant commenced legal action which culminated in its filing of the instant suit against the respondent on account of alleged infringement and passing off of appellant's well-known trademark by the respondent. Along with the said suit, the appellant filed an application seeking injunction against the respondent, while an interim injunction was granted to the appellant, however, in terms of the impugned order, the earlier injunction granted was dismissed.
The counsel for the appellant brought to our attention an application moved by the respondent for registration of its trademark filed at the Trademarks Registry bearing No.316901 dated 22.03.2012 in class 30. The learned counsel contended that when advertised, the said application was also opposed by the appellant which opposition bearing No.1662/2013 is still pending adjudication by the Registrar of Trademarks.
From the documents, we of course see that the respondent has also attempted to protect Rooh-e-Samar trademark under the copyright laws by making an application on 10.04.2014, we are not sure about the fate of the said application, however, even if registered that does not give any right to use the said label by the respondent in respect of any goods.
The counsel for the respondent, on the other hand placed heavy reliance on the grounds leveled in the impugned order and tried to take us at microscopic level to show minute difference between the rival marks (e.g. colour of grapes being green in the appellant's mark, while grapes of red colour appear in the respondent's mark) as well as the learned counsel contended that the calligraphy used by the respondent is of different style as compared to that of the appellant. Counsel also contended that while oranges appearing on respondent's wrapper is with skin, the appellant's orange is pealed! While counsel came with many astonishing contentions, one of it included mentioning of Article 18 of the Constitution, which provided for freedom of trade as well as to the novel contention that while customers of appellant's trademark are repeat customers and they purchase the appellant's products by using the brand name Roof Afza, while the respondent being a new entrant in the market, it has only first time buyers who after satisfied with the product place repeat orders. The counsel also stated that since the appellant's trademark is so popular that consumers ask for it by name, no confusion or deception could take place as respondent's trademark has not reached to that level of popularity and it is only purchased as Lal-Shurbat or by its own name Rooh-e-Samar. The counsel loaded us through a series of judgments, where Courts have held the trademark having different suffix and prefix can co-exist. He, inter alia, cited the examples of Coca-cola and Pepsi-cola in support of his client's case, which to us are of no influential value since we are dealing here with a mark that is probably most powerful Pakistani brand with unparalleled repute and domestic heritage and have achieved 6bis well-known trademark's protection under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. under unusual conditions.","Courts in a number of cases (2012 CLD 226, 2003 CLD 794, 2000 MLD 2057, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1987 MLD 2569, PLD 1970 Karachi 537, PLD 1969 Karachi 376, PLD 1958 Karachi 481) have discussed methods of finding confusion and deception in relation to rival trade marks primarily relying on the age-old and fundamental 'reaping without sowing' concept evolved in respect of trademarks in the year 1880 pursuant to the House of Lords judgment in the case of Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog (18 CD 396) holding that no man has a right to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader and he cannot, therefore, in the language of Lord Langdale, in the case of Perry v. Truefitt, (6 Beay. 66) be allowed to use names, marks or other indicia, by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person. Over the years some standard tests have been established in this regard. Most famous of these include ""Moron in a Hurry"" and ""Lapp"" tests arising out of Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited (1979 FSR 113) and Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 F.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1983) respectively; and the famous age-old ""Classic Trinity"" test. We will apply all these three tests in the case at hand.
With regards Classic Trinity, courts are required to consider following three aspects of the rival parties:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused (or to be caused) to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.
As one can see, classic trinity test, in a broader way, considers the same factors which the Lapp test does and now when we read all these tests in the light of the 1888 foundation judgment in the Singer case, the moral of all these tests remains the same. No one is allowed to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader by using names, marks or other indicia by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person.","The instant appeal is allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the respondent, its servants, agents, representatives and all persons claiming through it, are restrained from infringing the appellant's registered trademark Rooh Afza and Label in any manner by selling, marketing, offering for sale, advertising or otherwise using on its syrup trade mark Rooh-e-Samar either alone or in conjunction with any other mark, words, figures or devices.
","Beside the above tests, another important aspect that courts need to look at while considering rival trademarks for the possibility of passing test of infringement or passing off is to consider 'get-up' of the rival goods. A Practical Guide to Trade Mark Law by Amanda Michaels (Oxford University Press) defines 'Get-up' as the appearance of a trader's goods which are recognized by the customers. These features of appearance include the size, shape and colour schemes of a product as well as distinctive packaging or the arrangement of labels or the fascia, layout and fitting of a shop. 
Accordingly, get-up is often relied upon by a claimant in addition to the name or the trademark alone. In the instant case also, when we compare get-up of the rival products, we see clear resemblances. These include identical caps, ribs at the bottom of the bottle, word ""ROOH"" as predominant feature of the respondent's label, devices of fruits and the placement of wrapper at the same place as that on the appellant's products. Thus the overall impression left in the mind of an unwary purchaser is nearly the same. One must keep in mind that a person (urban shopper) sees or hears about more than 1500 trade marks in a day (Law for Business by M. M Sulphey and Az-Har Basheer - PHI Learning 2013) and thus not each and every microscopic element of each brand resides in a person's mind. There is a very limited sketch of a brand's get-up that resides in the mind of a purchaser, therefore courts need to come forward and protect that hazy picture developed in the mind of a purchaser by the owner of the original trade mark.
In the light of the foregoing where all three tests produce results favouring the appellant, we are of the view that use of the intended trademark, trade dress and get-up by the respondent infringes common-law right of the Appellants as well as their statutory rights provided pursuant to its registration and continuous use of its Rooh Afza trademark and trade-dress.","

","High Court Appeal No. 170 of 2003, decided on 18th May, 2004.",,,"Through these proceedings, the appellants have impugned order dated 23-5-2004 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.677 of 2001, filed by the respondent, allowing the injunction application of the respondent observing therein that the respondent in terms of section 21 of the Trade Marks Act have right to use the Trade Mark which is subject-matter of this appeal, to the exclusion of the appellants.
The facts, as it appear from the pleadings of the parties are that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court for infringement of trade mark, passing off, perpetual injunction, rendition of accounts and damages against the appellants. Alongwith the suit, the respondent made an application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. praying therein that the appellants be restrained from infringing the alleged trade mark and from passing off the goods. It appears that the matter was contested by the parties before the learned Single Judge who by his order, impugned in these proceedings, had allowed the application of the respondent restraining the appellants from infringing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, supplying, distributing or otherwise passing off the goods under the alleged trade mark `ALETRIS CORDIAL'.
 with contradictory witness statements.","Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the impugned order is bad in law and has failed to take notices' of the facts in its true perspective. He has further argued that the respondent had no prima facie case and were not entitled to the grant of injunction. According to the learned counsel once title in question of the trademark of a party was in dispute, the Court would riot grant injunction in favour of such a party. 
As against this, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge.","We fully endorse the findings of the Honourable Single Judge given in the impugned order while granting injunction. This Appeal is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs. However, office is directed to fix Suit No.677 of 2001 for settlement of issues within fifteen days and after the issues are settled the matter be listed for evidence, out of turn within 3 months after framing of issues.
 

 
","From the pleadings of the parties it appears that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court against the appellants claiming to be a Private Limited Company doing its business of medicines since 1948. In the plaint, the respondent has pleaded that besides the other, medicines of various brands, which the respondent was manufacturing and selling, the respondent claims to be registered proprietor of trade mark ""ALTERIS CORDIAL'. The respondent subsequently applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks to enter its name in the Register of Trade mark as subsequent proprietor of the said trade mark, which application was allowed and the respondent became subsequent proprietor of the trade mark. According to the respondent the homeopathic medicine by the name of `ALETRIS CORDIAL' under the said trade mark on the device of the bottle in the hand, with distinctive, get up, design and yellow and black colour scheme, due to its high quality gained popularity and was in great demand and, therefore, the respondent got valuable reputation and goodwill in respect of the said medicine in the market.
 
In the year 1998 the respondent came to know that the appellant No. 1 had applied and got registered the label of the respondent said registered trademark in the office of Registrar of Copyright as artistic copyright work label created by him. The respondent made an application for rectification under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, before the Board which application was allowed against which the appellants preferred an appeal which appeal is pending in the Lahore High Court. According to the respondent the appellant No. 1 is manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale his spurious medicine in the trade mark registered in the name of the respondent with the same colour, scheme, get up, design and style. The respondent has disputed the ownership of the Trade mark of the appellant No.1. The appellants in rebuttal filed Counter-Affidavit and Written Statement. It appears that the Honourable Single Judge heard the matter at length and thereafter has passed the impugned order with detail reasons.
 
The impugned order has been passed on an interlocutory application and the learned counsel for the appellants had argued that the grant of injunction when the damages were also claimed, ex-facie was erroneous order. If such an argument is accepted, the usurping of goodwill of the trade mark by the appellants who, prima facie, have no right under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, would be unjust as has been held in the case of TAPAL Tea (Private) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Company reported in 2002 CLD 1113. Pendency of proceedings in appeal preferred by the appellants against the order of the Board, is hardly a ground restricting the Court from granting injunction if a party was otherwise, entitled to such an injunction. Even otherwise, a person, prima facie, having no legal right, guaranteed in law, could not be allowed to continue his business in the face of the reasons advanced by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order. The impugned order has been passed on the material placed before the Honourable Single Judge and we find no reason to upset it. However, the appellants are at liberty to lead evidence to establish their legal right to do the business. The Honourable Single Judge has already observed in the impugned order that his findings were tentative in nature and is subject to evidence, which the parties may lead in support of their pleas. Even observations in the impugned order were held to be tentative and would not prejudice either party before the Registrar, Trade marks or before any forum.",S.A.K./R-11/K Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

","Civil Appeal No.223-K of 2011, decided on 4th July, 2012.
(Against the judgment dated 29-12-2010 passed by High Court of Sindh, Karachi in M.A. No.55 of 2004).",,,"This Appeal impugns the Judgment of the learned High Court of Sindh (Karachi) in Miscellaneous Application No.55 of 2004 whereby the appeal filed by the respondent was allowed. Consequently the Order of the Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26-6-2004 dismissing the application of the respondent for registration of its trade mark i.e. ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" was set aside.
 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985. In 1991 an advertisement appeared in the Trade mark Journal for ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" for tea in respect of the respondent which was opposed by the appellant. The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
 with an additional plaintiff.","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS, TRADE MARK REGISTRY and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Petitions Nos.2066 to 2068 of 2013, decided on 20th January, 2015.
 ",,,"Facts in brief, appear to be that Messrs International Foodstuff Company of UAE, (hereinafter abbreviated as IFFCO) the respondent No.2 herein, through Application No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997 applied for the registration of Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" for the goods in Class 29, which inter alia included ""edible oils, and fat; ghee; margarine"". Application inviting opposition for the said trade mark was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-2-2003 published on 14-6-2003, to which the petitioner filed Opposition No. 481 of 2003.

IFFCO, through yet another Application No. 189056 dated 1-8-2005, applied for the registration of trade mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-8-2005, published on 21-8-2005 to which also the petitioner filed opposition No.835/2006.

Petitioner adopted for itself Trade Mark styled as ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"", for the goods in Class 29 and applied for its registration through Application No. 179894, dated 24-8-2002, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal dated 1-1-2005, published on 11-11-2005, registration of which was challenged by the respondent No.2 through opposition No.01/2006 on the strength of their earlier Application for registration No. 140853 dated 11-4-1997.

All the Applications for the Registration of the competing mark and oppositions thereto, filed by the rival claimants under section 14(1) of the Act, 1940 were taken up, heard and decided by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks, through common order dated 29-9-2009. The Registrar of Trade Marks, in consideration of facts that the IFFCO through evidence has established to the satisfaction of Registrar that they are the originator, proponent and prior user of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"", which mark is not only registered in various jurisdictions but is also used in Middle Eastern and various other countries since 1990. In Pakistan, they started import of its goods (Oil and Ghee) under said brand name or Trademark since 1996, which was supplemented by various invoices evidencing import and use into Pakistan ever since, whereas, the petitioner adopted the competing mark and applied for its registration on 24-8-2002, after more than a decade of its adoption by the IFFCO. Consequently, both the Applications for the Registration of the Trade Mark ""HAYAT"" in Class 29, made by the IFFCO and their opposition to the Registration of the Trade Mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner were allowed and the Application for registration of impugned mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" filed by the petitioner and their Opposition Applications were also dismissed. with contradictory witness statements.","Learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner contended that both the marks are quite distinct. It was argued that thorough search was made in the Trade Marks Registry, and as per search report dated 23-10-2002 it was revealed that registered mark is ""nil"" and two applications in class 29 were pending for different products, and in market search, according to learned counsel for the petitioner, similar products were not available, therefore, bona fide and in good faith petitioner had adopted the mark ""FAROOQ'S Hayat"" for Banaspati Ghee, Cooking Oil, Edible Oil, and Palm Oil.
Contentions of the learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner are not substantiated from the record. The official search report (Memorandum) dated 23-10-2002 discloses that IFTCO's Application No.140853 for the trade mark HAYAT, was already pending in class 29 for ""Meat, fish, country and games; meat extracts, preserved dried and cooked fruits and vegetables; jellies; jam; fruit sauces; eggs, milk product; edible oils and fats; ghee; margarine; being goods included in class 29"" (page 41 in CPLA in 2067/13) (emphasis supplied), therefore, it cannot be urged that the petitioners were not aware of the adoption and use of Trademark 'HAYAT' by IFFCO.","No other grounds were urged. For what has been discussed above, order dated 29-9-2009 passed by the learned Registrar of Trade Marks and the impugned order dated 12-9-2013 passed by High Court in appeals, could not be interfered with. Consequently, the listed Civil Petitions are dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.","It may be observed that section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 forbids registration of trade mark and or a part of the trade mark that may comprise of or embraces, any scandalous design or any matter the use of which would by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice (emphasis added). Likewise section 10(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, puts a clog on the registration of trade mark in respect of any goods and or description of goods which is identical with a trade mark belonging to a different proprietor and either already registered in any of the acceding state in respect of same goods or descriptions of goods or ""which so nearly resembled such trade mark as to be likely deceive or cause confusion"". 
As regards contention of learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner that both the marks are quite distinct and dissimilar and there is no likelihood of confusion and or deception. According to him, use of prefix FAROOQ'S, the trading name of the petitioner to the word 'Hayat', distinguishes petitioners good from that of IFFCO. It may be observed that merely adding a prefix and or suffix to already existing trademark will not save the petitioner from the clutches of section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1940, which prohibits registration of a trade mark or a part of trade mark, which is ""likely to deceive or cause confusion"". Trade Marks Act, 1940 (as succeeded by Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, which came into force on 12-4-2004 per S.R.O. No.212(I)/2004) not only protect consumers, but also traders who adopt a particular trademark, which distinguishes their goods, products and services from other competing traders, producers and service providers. The Court also took note of the fact that many trade marks were already registered with prefix ""SUN"" This court allowed respondent the use of LIGHT within certain territorial bound and by adding its trade name SULTAN before LIGHT. Case of Ekhlas Ahmed 1980 SCMR 625, is of no help to the petitioner rather goes against the Petitioner. In the cited case, this Court itself examined the competing mark by examining the copy of carton of ""VEST"" applied for registration, with that of the trade mark ""VEET"" of the foreign based company and found visual and phonetic similarity between both the mark and declined to interfere in the finding recorded by High Court.
In instant case adoption of dominant feature being ""HAYAT"" is not only strikingly similar but is identical as noted above, merely adding prefix of ""FAROOQ'S"" in inconspicuous manner to the dominant or striking feature of the existing trademark HAYAT is of no consequence. The prefix ""FAROOQ'S"" as used by the petitioner in instant case does not eclipse, overshadows or obscures the dominating mark HAYAT in a way that may distinguish his goods with that of the goods of the IFFCO.
It is not very uncommon that unscrupulous traders or the manufacturers tend to confuse and or mislead consumers of goods of known or popular brands by taking shield and protection under various other laws governing intellectual property rights namely Patent, Merchandise, Designs, Trade Marks and or Copy Rights. There is growing tendency of using such terms interchangeably or treating such terms synonymously. It may be observed that there may be some similarities and overlapping in intent and purport of such rights, but rights of a proprietor/owner in each namely trademark, merchandise mark, Patent and Design and or Copyrights govern different category of intellectual properties and recognize host of different and special rights, obligations and remedies in their respective domain. There is growing tendency of misappropriating rights in one type of intellectual property by seeking protection under different statute governing altogether different intellectual property. Most abused are rights in trade marks under the garb of copyrights, later aims to protect original works of art or creative articulation may be of a trade mark in any tangible medium of expression, whereas, trademarks is associated with the goods for the purpose of indicating or so to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the rights, either as a proprietor or as registered user, to use or apply the trade mark on his goods. Trade Marks Act, 1940 protects the proprietor to use the trademark on his goods, and prevent others competitors from using and applying identical and or confusingly similar trade mark on their goods of similar class or description. There is no prohibition under the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for the competitors/traders from making, producing or marketing same or similar goods, only restriction placed is on the use and or adoption of same or deceptively and or confusingly similar trade mark. A trader may make or market or sell same or similar category of goods falling in same class but under different brand name or trade mark that clearly distinguishes its goods from same category or class of goods. Petitioner may continue to manufacture, produce and market its competing and similar goods under class 29, but under different brand name or trade mark.
It may be noted that Practice of using copyright as a substitute for the trademark was deprecated and defence of the infringer resting on registration of copyright was sternly rejected in large number of cases including cases reported as Tapal Tea (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Co. (2002 CLD 1113), Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), as upheld by a learned Division Bench in the case reported as Pak Drug House v. Rio Chemical (2003 CLD 1531), Messrs ADT Services AG v. ADT Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (2005 CLD 1546), Muhammad Wahid v. Adnan Memon (2010 CLD 450). In most of the reported cases, the Courts have rightly desired amendments to protect valuable rights and obligations in intellectual property under various statutes regulating such rights and obligation and arrest, misuse and abuse of such statute to the determent of honest and truthful traders and entrepreneurs.",MWA/F-8/SC Petition dismissed.,Dismissed.

","Suit Nos. 596, 880 and J.M. No. 28 of 2019, decided on 22nd September, 2020.","4th, 25th November, 2019, 21st May and 19th August, 2020","ZAFAR AHMED RAJPUT, J.","Suit No. 596 of 2019 has been filed by the MMC against the MRC and others for declaration, permanent injunction against the alleged infringement of the registered trademark/trade name ""MASTER"", passing off and unfair competition under Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""Ordinance, 2001""), rendition of accounts and damages, alleging therein that it being part of Master Group of Industries has diversified into many different industries such as foam, furniture, rubber products, building material, solar, wind and green energy, textiles and general trading. Besides, through the sale of its commercial vehicles, it has also established itself as a major player in the automotive industries and the most popular categories of its vehicles are MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE. It is further alleged that in the year 2015, the MMC collaborated with Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co. Ltd. and established a manufacturing plant in Karachi and the vehicles manufactured and assembled by the MMC with the collaboration of said company are being sold under various brands such as MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. It is also alleged that the MMC's vehicles sold under the trademark/trade name MASTER, either alone or in conjunction with another mark, have become well reputed amongst transporters and are in high demand in Pakistan and other countries including USA, UAE, Bangladesh, India and Afghanistan and MMC has duly secured its rights in the brand MASTER and obtained registration of the same in the relevant class-12 with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. It is the claim of MMC that being the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER, it owns the exclusive rights of selling, trading and dealing with the said trademark/trade name. It is further claim of the MMC that the trademark MASTER is associated exclusively with it, rendering the unauthorized use of it in conjunction with any other mark in respect of the same or similar products by other manufactures, service providers and traders as infringement of the MMC's vested rights and any such unauthorized use would also tantamount to passing off as well as unfair competition. It is case of the MMC that the MRC is engaged in the import, distribution and sale of infringing products bearing trademark/trade name MASTER, that products include buses under the mark 'ROAD MASTER' which is deceptively similar to the MMC's registered trademark MASTER in sheer negation and contravention of statutory provision enunciated under sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 and such inexcusable act is an infringement of MMC's exclusive proprietary rights vested in the trademark MASTER for which it is entitled to a relief under section 46 of the Ordinance, 2001. It is further case of MMC that MRC has imported the said infringing goods into Pakistan via Sri Lanka; hence, MMC apprehends that more consignments may be en-routed. It is also case of MMC that it has filed a complaint with Director General IPR (Enforcement), Islamabad under the relevant laws to take enforcement action and detain the infringing goods/vehicles, which is still pending adjudication; however, MMC in order to ensure that the infringing vehicles are not released, have approached this Court through this suit. MMC has filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019, under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C., seeking interim injunctive relief restraining MRC, its agents etc. from using/ infringing the trademark MASTER from marketing, promoting, trading, importing and selling through retail outlets or online and from infringing products under the mark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER in any manner whatsoever and/or any close variation thereof till disposal of this suit. While C.M.A. No.7781/2019 has been filed by the MRC, under Order XXXIX, rule 4 read with section 151, C.P.C., seeking vacation, discharge and modification in interim relief granted by this Court, vide orders dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019 and C.M.A. No.10445/2019 has been filed by MMC, under Order XXXIX, rule 2(3), C.P.C., read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Act, seeking attachment of the properties and an order detaining the proposed contemnors in civil prison for breach of ad-interim orders, dated 01.04.2019 and 15.04.2019, passed by this Court. under unusual conditions.","Mr. Mirza Mehmood Baig, learned counsel for MMC/plaintiff, while arguing listed applications in Suit No. 596/2019 has reiterated the facts of the plaint in said suit. He has contended that MMC is the registered proprietor of the trademark MASTER not only in Class 12 which pertains to the manufacture of the buses and apparatus for locomotion but also in Class 39 which pertains to transportation services and since MRC (defendant No.1 in said suit) is engaged in the import, distribution and/or sale of the infringing products bearing the trademark MASTER including buses under the mark ROAD MASTER, which is imitated mark upon the same goods of MMC, it filed Suit No.596/2019 inter alia to restrain MRC from using, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling of the plaintiff's products under the trademark MASTER and/or any variation thereof. He has further contended that vide ad-interim order, dated 01.04.2019, this Court restrained MRC from using the trademark and selling or infringing MMC's trademark MASTER; thereafter, vide order dated 15.4.2019, this Court extended the scope of the said ad-interim order to defendants Nos.2 to 7 and restrained them from releasing the goods carrying trademark of MMC and it was, thereafter, the MRC filed C.M.A. No.5145/2019 in said suit seeking discharge and/or modification of said interim order. He has further contended that the MRC has filed its counter affidavit to C.M.A. No. 5145/2019 wherein it has provided history of all its activities outside the transportation category with chronological developments and trademark registrations and applications that are entirely irrelevant to Classes 12 and 39. He has added that MRC instead of rebutting MMC's indomitable assertion and plea that it is the prior user and registered proprietor of the mark MASTER, placed its entire focus on irrelevant assertions, and miserably failed to establish prior use of the mark MASTER or ROAD MASTER upon buses or transportation services and MMC has already responded through its rejoinder to the counter affidavit submitted by MRC in response to the MMC's said C.M.A., wherein among other strong rebuttals, it has also been pointed out that MMC had secured interim relief in its favour as to the exclusive use of the trademark MASTER in numerous cases and foremost and relevant example of such relief in favour of MMC came about in Suit No.98/2019, filed before IPT Lahore, the very basis of that was its registration of the mark MASTER in Class 39.
On the other hand, Ms. Amna Salman Ahmed, learned counsel for MRC/defendant No.1 in Suit No.596/2019 while reiterating the facts of the plaint in Suit No.880/2019 has maintained that MMC has falsely claimed the ownership of the trademark MASTER, as the same has never been used by it, so also ROAD MASTER, for the goods and services falling in class 39, which MRC has been carrying out for its passenger and cargo transportation business. She has further maintained that the MMC has misused and abused its totally different class 12, Registration No.187815, which was malafidely and fraudulently obtained by it despite the fact that several MASTER formative marks were prior registered in class 12, therefore, MRC has filed J.M No. 28 of 2019 for the cancellation of the alleged registration of the trademark MASTER in class 12. She has also maintained that MRC is the bona fide user of mark ROAD MASTER in class 39 being the prior user of the said mark, furthermore, MMC has no justification to claim any right in relation to MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER used as a service mark in class 39 for passengers and cargo transportation services as they have never used MASTER or ROAD MASTER as a service mark for passengers and cargo transport services in class 39. She has further maintained that MRC's Master Group of Companies has honestly been using the trademark MASTER for four decades and it is well known throughout Pakistan and around the world, particularly in Middle East, therefore, MMC has no grounds to challenge the MRC's use of the trademark MASTER and/or ROAD MASTER, by filing a suit and obtaining restraining orders against the MRC. She has added that MMC has violated section 19 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. She has further added that MMC has no legal or moral right to press its illegal demands against MRC. She has also maintained that the averments made by MMC in the suit are unauthorized, mala fide and an act of fraud upon MRC and the public and in fact MMC is attempting to get benefit from the impression that they are the exclusive users and owners of the trademark MASTER and ROAD MASTER, otherwise the fact that they neither have any prior use nor do they have any current use in class 39 clearly proves their malicious intentions. She has added that MMC has failed to make out a prima facie case against the MRC nor have they been able to prove that they have suffered any irreparable loss whatsoever and the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of MMC; and it is the MRC who is suffering irreparable loss due to mala fide and illegal actions of MMC restraining MRC's buses at the port which are to be used for transport services and; therefore, the application for interim injunction (C.M.A. No. 5145/2019) is liable to be dismissed. ","The interim relief has already been confirmed in favour of MMC in Suit No. 596 of 2019 by denying the same to MRC in Suit No. 880 of 2019. Hence, C.M.A. No.7496/2019 is dismissed being devoid of merit. While C.M.A. No.10447/2019, filed by the MMC under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. seeking rejection of J.M is dismissed as the learned counsel has failed to refer the provision of law under that the instant J.M. is not maintainable. Moreover, the MRC under the law has right to challenge the registration of subject trademark on legal and factual grounds; the merit thereof cannot by decided without recording pro and contra evidence of the parties.
Above are the reasons of my short order, dated 19.08.2020, whereby C.M.A. No. 5145 of 2019 in Suit No. 596 of 2019 was allowed and rest of the C.M.As. were dismissed.
","In terms of section 39 (ibid), a registered trade mark is a property and proprietor thereof thus has an exclusive right in a registered trademark and in case of any infringement, the proprietor has the right to obtain any relief under the Ordinance, 2001 and under any other law for the time being in force. Section 40 covers the instances and provides elements of the infringements. Under section 40(1), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in a course of trade, a mark which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services, which are identical with those, for which it is registered. Under section 40(2), a person infringes a registered trade mark if such person uses in the course of trade a mark which is deceptively similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to the goods or services for which the trade mark is registered. Under section 40(3), a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to (a) goods of the same description as that of goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered; (b) services that are closely related to goods in respect of which trade mark is registered; (c) services of the same description as that of services in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or (d) goods that are closely related to services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Section 40 (4) provides that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trademark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered when deceptively similar to the registered trade mark. Section 40(5) stipulates that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if he uses such registered trade mark as his trade name or part of his trade name.
It appears from the pleadings of the parties that MMC claims to be a part of Master Group of Industries and is indulged in sale of commercial vehicles in the name of MASTER GRANDE and MASTER LINE and also manufacturing and selling buses under brand name MASTER FOTON and YUTONG MASTER. Profiles of said vehicles are annexed with plaint as annexure ""D"" at page 193 to 223. MMC claims that it has protected its rights in the brand MASTER by obtaining registration of the same in the relevant Class 12 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, pertaining to vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water, with Government of Pakistan, Trade Marks Registry, Karachi. Trademark Registration Certificate is annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""F"" at page 227.
it has been asserted that MMC is not the first ever adopter and user of the trademark MASTER for passenger and cargo transport business and services in Class 39 and it is the MRC who has prior use of ROAD MASTER as a service mark in said class. In its Affidavit-in-Rejoinder, MMC while rebutting the said assertion of the MRC has stated that it has been using the trademark MASTER upon services falling in class 39 since long before its use by MRC. Learned counsel for the MMC with his written synopsis has filed copy of the Trademark Registration Certificate bearing No. 197433 with filing date as 19-06-2004, which shows that MMC's trademark MASTER is registered in class 39, which was renewed for 10 years with effect from 19.06.2014 to 19.06.2024. It has been observed in the case of Messrs Dewan (supra) by this Court that once a trademark is registered under the provisions of Ordinance, 2001 it restricts the other parties from using such trade mark.",MH/M-50/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

It is engaged in the business of production, marketing and sale of a large variety (more than a hundred types) of food products at affordable prices, including but not limited to, dessert preparation mixtures, custards, jams, jellies, marmalades, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, sauces, recipe masalas, salts, snacks, spices and other ingredients (hereinafter the 'Complainant's Products').
4. The Complainant submitted that it has been using the word 'National' as a trademark, house mark and company name since 1970. Additionally it was stated that it has been using this registered trademark as a logo (copyright protected). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent started preparing, packing, marketing and selling imitated food products (hereinafter the ""Respondent's Products"") using a confusingly similar logo ""Shainal"" and packaging in terms of colour scheme, design and overall get up, to that of the Complainant's Products. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the following of its food products along with its product labelling and packaging were being imitated by the word National. 
With regard to the above allegations, an enquiry in terms of Section 37(2) of the Act was initiated by the Commission. The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""6.1 It appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, does amount to passing off its products as that of the Complainant's through fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and get up of products, in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) which prohibits fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging.
6.2 In view of the analysis, it also appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, has the potential to inflict harm upon the goodwill and business interest of the Complainant in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(a) and (b).
6.3 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large. 
Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Enquiry Report, the Commission approved the initiation of proceedings under Section 30 of the Act against the Respondent. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
""WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 in specific, it appears that the fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and getup of products by the Undertaking constitutes a prima facie violation of Section 10 (1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the fraudulent use of another's product labelling and packaging; and
WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.18 to 5.26 in specific, it appears that the Undertaking's conduct is not only capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant but also amounts to the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, which prima facie constitutes violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively;""

 with new technological evidence.","The issues for determination identified by the Commission are as follows:
A. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act through the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
B. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(b) of the Act through the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including information which lacks a reasonable basis, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
C. Whether, the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(a) through the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
","We note that during the enquiry as well as during the proceedings before the Commission the Respondent was given substantial time to amend/ revise its trade dress, however, no credible effort was made by the Respondent to change its trade dress and make it distinct from that of the Complainant. Hence, keeping in view the above, we are constrained to impose a penalty of PKR. 5,000,000/- (Rupees Five Million Only) on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
The Respondent is hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behaviour in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to cease and desist from the use of its Trade Dress (previous and revised submitted to the Commission) which is subject matter of this Order and similar to the Complainant's Trade Dress and Trade Mark, with immediate effect and not to use it in future. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's Trade Dress. The Respondent is also directed to file within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene any provision of the Act, in particular Section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondent shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of Section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
In terms of the above, SCN No. 34 /2016 is hereby disposed of.

","ISSUE A: 
According to Section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In simple terms, the mischief that Section 10 seeks to remedy is consumer deception. The Commission has established time and again that the term ""consumer"" is to be construed as the ordinary consumer for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act, reference in this regard is placed on 'in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zong reported as 2010 CLD 1478, wherein the Commission observed that 'restricting its interpretation with the use of the words `average', 'reasonable ' or 'prudent' will not only narrow down and put constraints on the effective implementation of the provision it would rather be contrary to the intent of law.
In its Order dated 8 February 2016 in the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. A Rahim Foods and reported as 2016 CLD 1128, the Commission expounded upon the concept of ""parasitic copying"" being an inherent part of the fraudulent use of another's product labeling and packaging. More specifically, the following explanation of parasitic copying demonstrates aptly the crucial aspects of the practice:
""Indeed parasitic copying typically consists in reproducing the main presentational features of market leading products (such as the shape of the product or of its packaging, color combination and graphic arrangement) but usually there is just enough difference to avoid a clear cut trade mark infringement.
Furthermore, the Commission is guided by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which contains provisions designed to tackle copycat packaging that misleads or confuses consumers. Article (1)(b) of the directive bans, commercial practices misleading consumers in relation to the main characteristics of the product, including its commercial origin. Article (2)(a), which is specifically dedicated to confusing marketing. Guided by the above general principles and adopting a holistic approach, the Commission's observations, on a juxtaposition of the images of the Complainant's Trade Dress and Respondent's Trade Dress are as follows:
i. There is no doubt that a pictorial comparison of the Complainant's Products and Respondent's Products leads to the obvious conclusion that there exist deceptively confusing similarities in the Complainant's Trade Dress and the Respondent's Trade Dress, almost to the extent of being identical but for the different brand names evident on the packaging.
As regards the allegation pertaining to the use of the name ""Shainal"" by the Respondent, it is observed that the same is a derivative of the brand name of two of the oldest market players, the Complainant i.e. ""National"" and ""Shan"". The name ""Shainal"" is a homophone of the brand name ""National"" in general and a combination of the words 'Shan' and National' in specific.
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of Section 10(1) in terms of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act to the extent of the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress.
ISSUE B: 
With respect to this issue, the Commission is required to determine whether the Respondent's copycat packaging of the Complainant's Trade Dress, also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to consumers within the scope of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.
Clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods; constitutes a deceptive marketing practice.
The terms ""misleading"" information has been interpreted by the Commission in the case reported as 2010 CLD 1478, as follows:
Misleading information: ""may essentially include oral or written statements or representations that are: (a) capable of giving wrong impression or idea, (b) likely to lead into error of conduct, thought or judgment, (c) tends to misinform or misguide owing to vagueness or any omission, (d) may or may not be deliberate or conscious, and (e) in contrast to false information, it has less erroneous connotation and is somewhat open to interpretation as the circumstances and conduct of a party may be treated as relevant to a certain extent"".
The Commission now considers the term 'reasonable basis' in light of section 10 of the Act. The concept of having a reasonable basis is an established doctrine in USA which was first recognised in the case of Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972).
In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the aforementioned conduct of the Respondent has resulted in a violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2) (b) of the Act, as the Respondent is disseminating misleading information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis, in the form of the confusing similarities of Respondent's Trade Dress to that of the Complainant's Trade Dress, thereby misleading the consumers as to the origin and place of production of the product.
ISSUE C: 
Clause (a) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information that it is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' shall be deemed to constitute a deceptive marketing practice.
This provision constitutes two main elements (i) the dissemination of false or misleading information (ii) that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking.
With reference to proving the actual harm caused to a competitors business interest, the Commission in its Order in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Jotun Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited reported as 2015 CLD 1638, stated that, actual harm to a competitors business interest need not be established to make out a violation in terms of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, the very presence of a deceptive market practice that has the potential to cause harm to the competitor's business is in fact sufficient to hold the Respondent culpable.
As per the ruling laid down by the Commission in the 2016 CLD 1128, ""in the event that there exists a contravention of Section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out"". Furthermore, as established above, copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, in itself also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to the public as it amounts to an unfair and deceptive trading practice. 
Based on the above, the Commission is of the considered opinion that, Respondent's practice of parasitic copying of the Complainant's Trade Dress, which appreciably impairs the consumer's ability to make an informed decision due to confusing similarities between the Respondent's Products and the Complainant's Products, being inherently deceptive, is in fact capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in contravention of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.",HBT/8/CCOP Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","First Appeal from Order No.213 of 2012, decided on 28th September, 2012.",,,"Appellant herein is a public limited company and claims to be the creator, originator, owner and user of trademark ""P"" in stylized form (hereafter stylized ""P"" logo) which it claims to be using since the inception of its business of cement manufacturing, marketing and selling for more than two decades. It claims to have launched a new brand of cement for export to Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics with the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device. It is claimed that cement bags with the said trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device were designed and printed for the appellant first time by a company called Syntronics Limited in May 2010.
The appellant claims to have engaged respondent No.3, a Pakistani company having its office in Peshawar as its distributor and submits that respondent No.3, as a distributor of the appellant, entered into a contract with an Afghan company named Shirkat-ul-Faisal and started exporting cement to Afghanistan under the trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device. It is alleged that after some time relationship between the appellant and respondent No.3 came to an end, whereafter respondent No.3 contracted appellant's competitor, respondent No.1, and started exporting cement to Shirakat-ul-Faisal in Afghanistan under appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo with Two Elephants device in utter disregard of law and violation of business ethics and with dishonesty and mala fide.
To restrain respondents from using the aforesaid trademark, the appellant filed a suit for infringement coupled with passing off the goods before the learned District Judge, Lahore, along with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. and the learned Additional District Judge granted a restraining order on 24th June, 2011 which was withdrawn through the impugned order dated 29-3-2012. 
The respondents resisted the suit and inter alia challenged the claim of proprietorship of the trademark by the appellant. Certain allegations about concealment of some facts concerning dealership were also raised and it was also asserted that Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited has obtained registration of Two Elephants device in Afghanistan. Strong reliance by the respondents was placed on obtaining trademark registration in Afghanistan by Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited in Afghanistan. under different legal circumstances.","Whether the appellant is the prior user and owner of the disputed trademark comprising the stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device and whether the respondents' use of the trademark constitutes infringement and passing off.","In the light of the above, this appeal is allowed and consequently the impugned order dated 29-3-2012, is set aside. The respondents are restrained to use the appellant's trademark stylized ""P"" logo and Two Elephants device till the final disposal of the suit. It is however noted that the observations made above are tentative in nature and would not influence the decision of the suit on merits after recording of evidence. As valuable rights of parties are involved it is ordered that the trial Court shall decide the suit within six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.","If Do Pheel/Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, a Director of respondent No.3, it seems inconceivable that they would continue to use it with stylized ""P"" logo, as stylized ""P"" logo is admittedly the trademark of appellant. This, prima facie, shows dishonesty on the part of the respondents. In this respect even if, for argument's sake, it is considered that Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4, then if, as per respondent's own stance that their dealership was unlawfully cancelled by the appellant, it was their legal, moral and ethical duty to have only taken their alleged Two Elephants device trademark to respondents Nos.1 and 2 (Fecto Cement Limited) to start export with Two Elephants device replacing appellant's stylized ""P"" logo with that of Fecto's own logo. This was apparently not done for obvious reasons that respondents desired to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" logo as a trademark of the appellant by virtue of its use on cement exported to Afghanistan.
There is a further aspect to respondents' prima facie dishonest act and their efforts to deceive the Courts. If Two Elephants was the brainchild of respondent No.4 (Mr. S. Mehtab Hussain), a Director of respondent No.3, then it is not understandable why they would allow Shirkat-ul-Faisal Limited, which is a separate entity, to register it in its name in Afghanistan and not in the name of the said respondent or respondent No.3. 
As far as Distributorship is concerned it is pertinent to note that respondents in their written statement have admitted the existence of distributorship and have referred to it as well as attached a copy of said letter in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Factual Matrix of the written statement as reproduced below:--

(1) That the plaintiff approached defendant(s) Nos.3 and 4 in order to subscribe to their services as exclusive and sole distributor(s)/dealer(s). The plaintiff, at all material times, represented and assured that defendant No.3 would be engaged to the exclusion of all others. It is submitted that Dho Pheel/(the two elephants) was the brainchild of defendant No.4, who is and was at all material times, the Director of defendant No.3.

(2) That the plaintiff through its General Manager (Marketing and Sales), Mr. Rizwari Butt, confirmed the appointment of defendant No.4 as the authorized Sole Distributor for Afghanistan and CARs (Central Asian Republics) through a letter dated 29-3-2010. A copy of the letter dated 29-3-2010 is placed herewith as Annex-E.

(3) That the albeit it is beyond the scope of the present proceedings, it is nevertheless the case that the plaintiff flagrantly breached the Dealership Agreement, which it had struck with defendant No.3. Consequently, the latter, on the plaintiff's contractual repudiation, was but only impelled to enter into a Dealership Agreement dated 20-4-2011 with defendant No.1 (viz, Fecto Cement Limited). A copy of an email written by defendant No.4 to the General Manager of defendant No.1 substantiating these state of affairs is placed herewith as Annex -F.
The learned trial Court has stated the correct principle that in trademark cases most important factor is who is prior user of trademark. This principle is in particular applicable when none of the contesting parties is armed with a registered trademark. Despite stating the correct principle, in my humble view, the learned trial Judge committed a serious error when he concluded that the plaintiff company (appellant) did not produce any cogent and convincing material in this regard. This apparently reflects that the learned trial Judge did not pay much attention to the pleadings of the parties nor perused the documents available on the record. 
In the present case, there is admittance on the part of the respondents that respondent No.3 has acted as a distributor for the appellant and sold appellant's cement with the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device to Afghanistan. Therefore, there is no denial or challenge that the trademark stylized ""P"" and Two Elephants device was not first used by the appellant and cement with this trademark was not sold in Afghanistan through respondent No.3 as a distributor of appellant and thus there is no denial that appellant is the prior user of the disputed trademark.
In my humble opinion the distributor's appointment letter and above admitted facts were sufficient to, prima facie, show that appellant was the prior user and prior owner of the Two Elephants and stylized ""P"" trademark for cement. Moreover the respondents have not explained the reason for their choice to use the stylized ""P"" logo along with Two Elephants, when respondent No.1 itself seems to be a well known company, it should have chosen to use its own independent logo and not that of its competitors. It is in particular not appreciable that big business groups resort to copying their competitors trademarks, as, prima facie, seems to be the case here.
In the light of the above, it clearly appears that the appellant has made out a prima facie case in its favour and is likely to suffer irreparable loss if the respondents are not restrained from using the stylized ""P"" logo and the Two Elephants device. I must add here that trademark rights are lifelines of businesses and unauthorized use of owner's trademark by third parties results in un-quantifiable loss and damage to its goodwill and business which is irreparable in nature. Thus the loss that the appellant is likely to suffer as a result of use of appellant's trademark by the respondents cannot be calculated in terms of monetary compensation and would be irreparable in nature. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the appellant. I must also observe that under section 46(2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 all such reliefs by way of damages, injunction, accounts are available to the proprietor of a trademark simultaneously and not as an alternate to each other and just because in addition to interim injunction a plaintiff may claim damages and compensation in a suit relating to trademark rights, interim relief cannot be denied on that ground.

","File No. 274/FEROZSONS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 24th September, 2018.","22nd May, 2018.",nil,"The Complainant is a public limited company registered under the law of Pakistan, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing, importing, packaging and selling certain medicinal/ pharmaceutical products across Pakistan. As is submitted in the Complaint, the Complainant is the sole distributor and right holder in Pakistan of a complete range of products sold under the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"", registered with The Trade Marks Registry in Karachi, Pakistan bearing trademark No. 179961 dated 28 August 2002 in class 5 for analgesic (pain relieving) pharmaceutical preparations. The products are sold in the form of spray, gel, and roll-on of different specifications bearing distinctive getup and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising predominantly of green and light blue coloured text and white background. Furthermore, it was submitted that the Complainant is enlisted with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) as the authorized importer and distributor of pharmaceutical products branded as ""BIOFREEZE"". The Complainant averred that the Respondent was fraudulently using similar, deceptive or confusingly similar mark ""BYQFREEZ"" in relation to similar pharmaceutical preparations in the form of spray and gel so as to pass off them as and for the products of the Complainant, which tantamount deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
4. The Enquiry Report examined whether the Respondent has contravened the provisions of section 10 of the Act. It was found that the Complainant is the authorized importer/distributor of ""BIO/FREEZE"" branded product line. Whereas the Respondent was engaged in the manufacture and sale of products branded as ""BYQFREEZ"" which were deceptively similar viz., phonetic similarity with the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" bearing highly similar label/design/colour to the unique, distinctive label/design/colour scheme with the Complainant's products. The Enquiry Report concluded that the Respondent's unauthorized and dishonest adoption of deceptively and/or confusingly similar trademark appears to be fraudulent use of trademark and labelling and packaging in contravention of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act. Furthermore, it was concluded that the Respondent appears to be disseminating false and misleading information, including its substantially lower pricing in the market to the detriment of consumers and competitors in contravention of clause (b) and clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.  under heightened security.","In view of the submissions made by the parties in the subject proceedings, following issues merit deliberation:
i. Whether the Complainant's claim qua the trademark 'BIOFREEZE' and associated trade dress is valid for the purposes of section 10 of the Act?
ii. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of clauses (d), (b) and (a) of subsection (2) read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act?
","the Complainant has made out its case that it is registered and authorized right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress in this case.
34. The Respondent, its proprietors, partners, directors, associates, agents, dealers, among others, are hereby restrained from using the impugned marks ""BYQFREEZ"" or any other mark with any prefix or suffix and trade dress that is phonetically, visually and constructively similar as that of the Complainant mark ""BIOFREEZE"" and its associated trade dress.
The Respondent has undertaken before the Bench that it will not repeat the contravention and comply with the provisions of section 10 of the Act. We, therefore, are inclined to take a lenient view and imposes penalty in the amount of PKR 2,500,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Hundred Thousand Only) pursuant to Section 38 of the Act on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is further directed to file, within sixty (60) days from the date of this order, a compliance report with reference to withdrawal of the products under the mark ""BYQFREEZ"" and stop using the said mark.
In case of non-compliance with the directions contained in Paras 34 and 35 ibid. of this order, the Respondent shall be further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to PKR 100,000 (Rupees one hundred thousand) per day from the date of this order.
38. In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.
","Before proceeding with the factual analysis, we would like to highlight and briefly explain the scope and objective of section 10 of the Act, which reads as follows:
'10. Deceptive marketing practices.---(1) No undertaking shall enter into deceptive marketing practices.
(2) The deceptive marketing practices shall be deemed to have been resorted to or continued of an Undertaking resorts to-
(a) the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking;
(b) the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods;
(c) [....]
(d) fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling and packaging.
Section 10 applies to all undertakings in Pakistan, regardless of their size and the way in which they are established or financed. The provisions of section 10 mandate the Commission to eliminate all causes of consumer deception or deceptive marketing practices. For deception to occur, there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumers. Second, the Commission examines the representation, omission or practice (collectively, ""practice"") from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. Reasonable is examined from the perspective of the ordinary consumer of the target group. Third, the representation, omission, or practice must be a ""material"" one. That is to say, whether the practice is likely to affect the consumer's conduct in terms of its purchasing decision viz., products or services. Advertising statements, disclosures, disclaimers or point of sale representations, inter alia, are the points where consumer first contacts between a seller and buyers. Whether or not a consumer buys a product is immaterial. The law may still be violated. Thus, a practice is material, there is the likelihood of consumer deception because it is presumed that the consumer might have chosen differently or made a different purchasing decision but for deception.
Keeping in view the alleged contravention, we are not concerned with the ""subjective intention"" but with the ""objective manifestation"" of intent to examine the concept of ""fraudulent use"". The prohibition, under clause (d) subsection (2) of section 10, applies to all forms of marks, including words, numbers, logos, pictures given that they function as source-identifier of a good or service.
Moreover, the application of the above clause does not differentiate between a registered and an unregistered mark. Nevertheless, with registration, a right holders' array of options for dealing with the unauthorized or fraudulent use of a trademark or trade dress is likely to increase. The registered trademarks, firm name or labelling and packaging are presumed to be valid and incontestable. Most importantly, they are used as apparatus to seek remedy against imitators claiming unawareness of the registration. By virtue of section 10, the legislature have, therefore, intended to protect consumers and trademark (and other commercial signs e.g., trade dress, symbols, colours or colour scheme, product shapes and product packaging and marketing themes, etc.) proprietors to be deprived of the property at the instance of business undertakings whose use is unauthorized and fraudulent.
It transpires from the record that M/s Performance Health, USA already had registered its trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" in 2002 in Pakistan and has successfully renewed it for a further period of ten years from 28 August 2009. Since its registration M/s. Performance Health have been commercially exploiting its trademark by way of export, distribution, marketing and sale of ""BIOFREEZE"" labelled products in Pakistan. At present, the Complainant is the sole licensor and authorized distributor of ""BIOFREEZE"" products of M/s Health Performance in Pakistan. Therefore, we are convinced that registration of the Trademark ""BIOFREEZ"" in favour of the Complainant is valid. Consequently, the Complainant, holds valid right to initiate action(s) against the imitators of its trademark and labelling and packaging under clause (d), subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.

In the Complaint as well as the Enquiry Report concluded that prima facie the Respondent has violated section 10 of the Act that is designated to protect consumers against unfair, deceptive, fraudulent trade and business practices and false advertising. In its previous decisions, the Commission has underscored certain key principles to assess the fraudulent use of another's trademark, misleading and deceptive labelling and packaging, and advertising, among other things. The following paragraphs briefly highlight the principles laid down under clause (d) subsection (2) section 10 of read with subsection (1) section 10 of the Act.
16. The Commission in one of its earlier Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of M/s. A. Rahim Food Pvt. Limited reported as 2016 CLD 1128, observed that ""parasitic copying"" (Look-alikes) of trademark and trade dress of a brand are inherent in all cases of ""fraudulent"" use of another's trademark, firm name, labelling, and packaging' and has laid down the following standards:
'a) It is now well-established principle under the majority of regulatory competition regimes around the world that mimicking the packaging design of familiar established brands is a misleading and deceptive ploy with the end purpose of boosting sales.
b) Such purpose or object of parasitic copycat packaging is driven [...] from [...] the perspective of the consumer. A potential purchaser is much more likely to mistake and perceive products which employ parasitic copying to be of better quality than they in fact are or as equivalent to the aggrieved competitor or market leader (whose packaging has been copied). Hence, a consumer is more likely to purchase such a product, rather than if the packaging was clearly distinctive and distinguishable.
c) The end result of such a practice is that the consumer is misled by the ""copycat"" who is fraudulently attempting to pass off its products as something else. Furthermore, the copycat incurs the minimal cost and in fact none of the cost of investment and innovation of a design that the market leader has spent to build goodwill and reputation of its brand assets in the relevant market. Hence, where product differentiation is insufficient, such a practice on the part of the copycat has fatal consequences for the business of the market leader.
d) In furtherance to the interpretation of the term ""fraudulent use [of another's trademark] "" of ""product labelling and packaging"" within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, it may be noted that fraud itself consists of some deceitful practice or wilful device to obtain an unjust advantage and which deprives another of right or causes another injury. The Commission, entrusted with the task of adjudicating upon a potential contravention under the Act, remains of the much wider context and purpose of the said prohibition. The Commission shall therefore, be satisfied that the evidence adduced before it is conclusive, if the strikingly similar packaging and labelling is misleading enough to cause confusion in the minds of average consumer of a commodity, with the end result of unjust advantage accruing to the copycat at the expense of and to the detriment of the complainant.
e) The Commission deems it appropriate to examine the packaging and product labelling appearance of a finished product as a whole which may collectively include visually confusing resemblance in elements of colour scheme, layout style, design, images, labels, font usage etc., instead of each individual similarity, in isolation, to come to its determination as to the contravention under section 10(2)(d) of the Act. It may also be noted that the Commission takes into account the surrounding circumstances which may be different in each particular case, as being peculiar to the parties, products, consumers and the relevant market.
f) Lastly, it may be noted that the worldwide consumer survey-based consensus is that when copycat packaging is developed for a particular commodity, price becomes the main and sometimes only criterion which affects a consumer's choice of purchase. Furthermore, when price becomes the sole determining factor for the exercise of choice between two products with no other meaningful distinguishing factor existing between such products, it is evidence of the presence of parasitic copying.

Anchor Health and Beauty Care (Pvt.) Limited (2003) PTC 478 Del, wherein Colgate sought [...] to restrain Anchor Health's use of the trade dress and colour combination of red and white in relation to identical products i.e. tooth powder, even though the latter's trademark/tradename was completely different, the Court held that:
'52. It is overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, shape of the container, packaging etc.'
...
'If the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, get-up and layout appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one's own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter'.
Now keeping in view the parties' conduct and submissions before us, the facts scenarios in the instant case may be summarized as follows:
(i) The Complainant has claimed to be the registered proprietor of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" and has stated to have adopted the trademark in respect of certain analgesic harmaceutical preparations and is distributing/selling in Pakistan since at least 2004. Furthermore, the Complainant has claimed to be the proprietor of the trade dress, which includes the containers and labels (comprising predominantly green and light blue colours with white background) of the products. The Complainant has submitted that on account of the efficacy and rigorous marketing the brand name ""BIOFREEZE"" and its unique trade dress have accumulated immense goodwill and international reputation including in Pakistan amongst the relevant members of trade as well as the public-at-large. Against this backdrop, the Complainant has alleged that by use of identical or deceptively similar trademark such as ""BYQFREEZ"" by the Respondent and appropriating or adopting prominently similar trade dress in terms of bottling, layout, get up and colour combination with obvious intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and deceive consumers, the Respondent has acted in contravention of section 10 of the Act.
(ii) The Respondent, on the other hand, has denied the allegations of passing off and deceptive marketing practices. In support of its case, the Respondent has contended that the two marks i.e. ""BIOFREEZE"" and ""BYQFREEZ HPRR"" are not identical. Furthermore, the Respondent has submitted that the ingredients of the Respondent's product are much different than the Complainants'. On 21.9.2017, the Complainant has deposed that between 2003 and 2014 it was the sole distributor of M/s. Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" product line in Pakistan. However, its distributorship was terminated in early 2014 because it failed to achieve its sales targets. Thereafter, the Respondent adopted ""Neucon Pakistan"" as its new business name. According to the Respondent, when it was intimated that the Complainant is the new authorized licensee/distributor of M/s Health Performance for ""BIOFREEZE"" products in Pakistan, it launched its own brand ""BIOFREEZ HPQR"" for similar products i.e. analgesic pharmaceutical preparations. Currently, the Respondent has four distributors in Pakistan and its products are sold to the masses at pharmacies.
In view of the above, the we are of the considered opinion that the Complainant has proved beyond doubt that it is the registered proprietor and right-holder of the trademark ""BIOFREEZE"" as well as the trade dress i.e. green and light blue labelling and packaging of the products in question. Hence it has the exclusive right to use the trademark including trade dress of ""BIOFREEZE"". By adoption of an identical trademark i.e. ""BYQFREEZ"" and the trade dress - the overall getup, the Respondent has contravened clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 read with subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act.
26. The Commission also finds that it is highly likely that the consumers would be deceived/misled by false and misleading depictions of the Respondent which constitutes a contravention of section 10(2)(b) read with section 10(1) of the Act. The Commission further finds that by resorting to the aforesaid practices the Respondent has failed to fulfil its obligation to avoid unfair competition and become unjustly rich by encashing on the goodwill or reputation of the Complainant, hence in violation of section 10(2)(a) read with section 10(1) of the Act.

",25.01.2017,"SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, J.","Briefly, the facts of the case are that K&N's Foods (Pvt) Limited (""K&N's Foods"") filed a complaint against A. Rahim Foods (Pvt) Limited (""Rahim Foods"") with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (""Commission""), asserting involvement of Rahim Foods in deceptive marketing practices in contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act. In the complaint, K&N's Foods mainly alleged that Rahim Foods was copying the K&N's Foods product labelling and packaging for the sale of its several frozen and processed meat products. It also alleged copying of its trademark term ""Combo Wings"" by Rahim Foods for one of the products, that is, the chicken wings. Two officers of the Commission, under the delegated powers, conducted an enquiry into the matter complained of. After collecting and considering the respective evidence of the parties, the enquiry officers submitted their report confirming the allegations and proposing the initiation of proceedings against Rahim Foods under Section 30 of the Act. with new technological evidence.","(A) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging is misleadingly similar to that of the Complainant's K&N Packing and if so, whether such confusing resemblance is deceptive and amounts to ""fraudulent use of another's ..product labelling or packaging"" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(B) Whether the use of the term/mark 'Combo Wings' by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], in the absence of authorization from the Complainant [K&N's Foods], amounts to """"fraudulent use of another's trademark..."" within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
(C) Whether the Respondent's [Rahim Foods'] product labelling and packaging and/or use of the mark 'Combo Wings' amount to the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interest"" of the Complainant [K&N's Foods] within the meaning andPLD
 scope of Section 10(2)(a) and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.","Pursuant to its findings on the said issues, the Commission imposed the following penalties on Rahim Foods for contravention of the provisions of section 10, under section 38 of the Act:
i. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
ii. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
In the exercise of its powers under section 31(c) of the Act, the Commission further directed Rahim Foods to cease the use of the contentious copycat packaging for its frozen and processed meat products and to ensure that the products were repackaged in a manner that was distinct in its overall layout so as to be easily distinguishable from that of the K&N's Foods products.
","the Commission observed that as the trademark ""Combo Wings"" had not been registered at the time of lodging of the complaint by K&N's Foods, its use by Rahim Foods did not constitute a contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act, but decided this issue in affirmative with the following observations:
However, the use of the term ""Combo Wings"" by the Respondent [Rahim Foods], when seen in conjunction with the overall layout and design of the copied and duplicated K&N Packaging, demonstrates the Respondent's intention to pass off its products as those of the Complainant [K&N's Foods]. To such extent only, and as part of its overall scheme of deception, the use of the term in question falls within the scope of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, as fraudulent use of another's product labelling.
The Commission and the Tribunal both have also concurred on the point that the above facts fall within the prohibition of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(d) though they have differed on the applicability of Section 10(2)(a) of the Act. They have also expressed divergent views on the requirement of registration of a trademark to attract the provisions of Section 10(2)(d) for ""fraudulent use of another's trademark"".",The appeal filed by the Commission in the present case against the decision of the Tribunal setting aside partially its quasi-judicial order is therefore not maintainable.,Dismissed

","Civil Petition No. 3795 of 2021, decided on 8th November, 2021.
(Against the judgment dated 26.02.2021 of the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad passed in F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020)
","8th November, 2021.","MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.","It was averred that the petitioner and respondent No.1 entered into a partnership agreement to conduct business of promoting, developing and managing international franchises. A partnership firm was thus formed and registered by the name of Zakori International (""Zakori International""). Zakori International is currently operating two successful brands in Pakistan namely ""Mr. COD"" and ""RANCHERS"". ""RANCHERS"", being an indigenous brand of Zakori International, the trademark ""Ranchers"" has been registered under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance 2001""), in the joint name of the partners, being the petitioner and respondent No.1. It is further stated that under and in terms of a franchise agreement dated 13.10.2015, Zakori International granted to Messrs Royal Manor a limited license and franchise for operating a ""Ranchers"" Restaurant in Sector 1-8 (Markaz), Islamabad. However the respondent No.1, without the consent of the petitioner, entered, on behalf of Zakori International, into a tripartite Joint Venture Agreement (""JVA"") with Messrs Royal Manor, and one Afnan Shareef, the Respondent No.2, whereby Royal Manor agreed to take respondent No.2, as its joint venture partner in respect of the franchise restaurants operated by it under the name and style of ""Ranchers"", whereas Zakori International in terms of the said JVA, purportedly undertook to grant master franchising rights regarding ""Ranchers"" to respondent No.2. The petitioner contended that Zakori International could not have participated in the aforesaid JVA without the consent of the petitioner. It was further contended that by having agreed to extend to respondent No.2, the right of master franchising ""Ranchers"" unilaterally, and without the consent of the petitioner, the respondent No.2 has clearly infringed the registered trade mark, jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, against the clear restriction imposed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001. In addition to the above, according to the petitioner, respondent Nos.1 and 2, have incorporated a Private Limited Company by the name of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3, mainly for the same business as is being conducted by Zakori International under its trade mark ""Ranchers"". It was contended that the use of the trade mark/name, ""Ranchers"", by respondent No.3 company, will create an impression and lead to a belief that the entity is not different from, ""Ranchers"" jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, and such would ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"". with an additional plaintiff.","The first grievance of the petitioner that emerges from the plain reading of the plaint, and as noted earlier, is that though the petitioner and respondent No.1 are the co-owners of the registered trade mark ""Ranchers"" and the partnership agreement between the two does not authorize any of them to grant a license to the use of the said trade mark, or assign or charge each other's share therein, and exactly to the same effect is the restriction placed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001, however the respondent No.1 without the petitioner's consent granted master franchise rights in respect of the subject trade mark to respondent No.2, which is clearly violative of the above provision and thus in terms of subsection (6) of section 24 of the said Ordinance, which clearly entitles the aggrieved co-proprietor to initiate infringement proceedings in such an eventuality, the petitioner was/is fully competent to institute the proceedings as he did.
7. The other grievance as set out in the plaint is that the respondent No.1 and respondent No.2, along with two others have incorporated a private limited company by the name and style of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3. It is contended that the name of the company conspicuously bearing the name ""Ranchers"" whose principal line of business is the same as that being conducted by the Zakori International under the trade mark/name ""Ranchers"" would lead a consumer into believing that the respondent No.3 company is associated with the ""Ranchers"" brand owned by Zakori International, and thus using the name ""Ranchers"" as above is a clear infringement of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" as described/explained by section 40 of the Ordinance 2001, in terms whereof a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses, in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or deceitfully similar thereto, in relation to similar goods or services for which the same is registered, whereas subsection (5) of section 40 holds unauthorized use of a registered trade mark as one's own trade name or part of his trade name, as an infringement of the trade mark, and this is what exactly is being complained of by the petitioner.
","In view of the forgoing we convert this petition into an appeal and allow the same, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the tribunal to proceed therewith in accordance with law.","Although, as noted above, the respondents' acts and conduct as alleged by the petitioner clearly falls under sections 24 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 respectively, but for the sake of clarity we may observe here that use of trade mark can also be attributed to the person who has got to the stage where he can be seen objectively to have committed himself to use the mark that is to carrying his intention to use the mark into effect. Use of trade mark can therefore be demonstrated also through the intention to offer the goods and services and/or services, which are manifested through preparatory steps which show an objective commitment to using the trade mark, whereas in the instant case the respondents, in addition to having violated specific provisions of Ordinance, 2001, have also gone beyond the preparatory steps. We wonder as to where from the question of so called physical use arose.
Keeping in view certain observations found in the judgments of the fora below, we feel that a clear exposition with regard to the concept of passing off would be beneficial, and it would be appropriate to reproduce the concept as enunciated in Harvard's Law Review, Volume 68 (1954-1955) on the subject of development in the law.
Whereas though in the instant case, the petitioner contended that use of ""Ranchers"", as part of the company's name ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"", however, as noted earlier, has in fact alleged violation of specific restriction imposed by two separate provisions of Ordinance 2001, which are clearly based on infringement of petitioner's trade mark, within the meaning of the said two provisions.
It may also be relevant to note that what is described as a passing off action may either be a passing off action simplicitor or an action of infringement of trade mark coupled with passing off. Where the case of passing off action is based on infringement of trade mark, such suit shall necessarily require determination of the question whether there had been any infringement of the trade mark and where infringement of trade mark is alleged the suit must, in view of sections 17, 18 and 39 of the IPO Act, 2012, be instituted before the tribunal notwithstanding that the allegations in the suit were coupled with the allegation of passing off.

(i) there must be a compromise / arrangement/ Scheme
(ii) proposed between a company and its creditors
(iii) application to be made to the Commission now the High Court, as defined above;
(iv) supported by meetings
(v) mandatory filing of material facts relating to the company which is;
(a) financial position
(b) auditor's report
(c) latest accounts of the company
(d) the pendency of any investigation proceedings
(e) supported by the affidavits
Now moving forward, as highlighted above, the expression 'demerger' is not expressly defined in the Companies Act. Sections 279 to 282 of the Companies Act contain provisions regarding Compromises, Arrangement and Reconstruction. However, it could very well be said that the same is covered under the expression arrangement, as defined in subsection (6) of Section 279 of the Companies Act which reads as follows:
"" .the expression ""arrangement"" includes a re-organization of the share-capital of the company by the consolidation of shares of different classes or by the division of shares into shares of different classes or by both those methods, .""
23. Moreover the term demerger has also not been defined in the Indian Companies Act of 2013 which repealed the Companies Act of 1956. However the term demerger finds mention in subsection (19AA) of Section 2 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. According to the said subsection, demerger in relation to companies, means transfer, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.
","Being a sanctioning Court, I have noticed that all indispensable statutory benchmarks, requirements and formalities have been accomplished and adhered to by the petitioners as envisioned under the relevant provisions of the law, including the holding/convening of the requisite meetings as contemplated under the relevant provisions and rules and the resolutions passed by the members have already been highlighted. The scheme set up for sanction has been reinforced and fortified by the requisite majority which decision seems to be just and fair. The report/minutes of meetings unequivocally convey that all essential and fundamental characteristics and attributes of schemes were placed before the voters at the concerned meetings to live up to statutory obligations. The proposed schemes are not found to be violative of any provision of law and/or contrary to public policy but as a whole looks like evenhanded and serviceable from the point of view of a prudent man of business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by him for whom the scheme is meant. As explained in the above case precedents, once the requirements of a scheme for getting sanction of the court are found to have been met, the court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval of the scheme. There does not remain any objection to the scheme of arrangement and no mistake, conspicuous, detectable shortcoming or flaw has further been pointed out in the present matter before me.
36. In view of the forgoing reasons, there remains no impediment to grant and sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the Scheme attached at Annex-A (sic.) is hereby sanctioned in terms thereof.
","Under the Companies Act and the previous Companies Ordinance, 1984 (the ""Ordinance""), the Courts have allowed mergers by stating where all the requisite formalities were complied with including shareholders' approval, the Court would not question the commercial wisdom behind the scheme. One of the effects of the sanction of the Court is that it becomes binding upon the company and its members including those who voted against the scheme once the scheme of compromise and arrangement is approved by statutory majority it binds the dissenting minority and the company. The Court has the power to give effect to all the incidental and ancillary questions in the effort to satisfy itself whether the scheme has the approval of the requisite majority. It is not the function of the Court to examine whether there is a scope for better scheme. However, where the Court finds that scheme is patently fraudulent, it may not respond or function as mere rubber stamp or post office but reject the scheme of arrangement.
30. Furthermore, in the Indian Supreme Court case of Miheer H. Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. reported in AIR 1997 Supreme Court 506, it was held that the court certainly would not act as a court of appeal and sit in judgment over the informed view of the concerned parties to the compromise as the same would be in the realm of corporate and commercial wisdom of the concerned parties. The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the Scheme by the requisite majority. Consequently the Company Court's jurisdiction to that extent is peripheral and supervisory and not appellate.
31. Based on the jurisprudence in Company Law developed by Pakistani, English and Indian cases, discussed above, and in light of the applicable sections of the Companies Act, the Court acts like an umpire in a game of cricket who has to see that both the teams play their game according to the rules and do not overstep the limits. The propriety and the merits of the compromise or arrangement have to be judged by the parties who as sui juris with their open eyes and fully informed about the pros and cons of the Scheme arrive at their own reasoned judgment and agree to be bound by such compromise or arrangement.

MESSRS SHAINAL AL-SYED FOODS FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:"," In the matter of
File No. 205/OFT/SHAINAL/CCP/2015, decided on 30th March, 2018.
",,,"The Complainant is a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 in Pakistan since 19 February 1970. It is engaged in the business of production, marketing and sale of a large variety (more than a hundred types) of food products at affordable prices, including but not limited to, dessert preparation mixtures, custards, jams, jellies, marmalades, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, sauces, recipe masalas, salts, snacks, spices and other ingredients (hereinafter the 'Complainant's Products').
4. The Complainant submitted that it has been using the word 'National' as a trademark, house mark and company name since 1970. Additionally it was stated that it has been using this registered trademark as a logo (copyright protected). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent started preparing, packing, marketing and selling imitated food products (hereinafter the ""Respondent's Products"") using a confusingly similar logo ""Shainal"" and packaging in terms of colour scheme, design and overall get up, to that of the Complainant's Products. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the following of its food products along with its product labelling and packaging were being imitated by the word National. 
With regard to the above allegations, an enquiry in terms of Section 37(2) of the Act was initiated by the Commission. The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""6.1 It appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, does amount to passing off its products as that of the Complainant's through fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and get up of products, in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) which prohibits fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging.
6.2 In view of the analysis, it also appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, has the potential to inflict harm upon the goodwill and business interest of the Complainant in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(a) and (b).
6.3 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large. 
Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Enquiry Report, the Commission approved the initiation of proceedings under Section 30 of the Act against the Respondent. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
""WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 in specific, it appears that the fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and getup of products by the Undertaking constitutes a prima facie violation of Section 10 (1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the fraudulent use of another's product labelling and packaging; and
WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.18 to 5.26 in specific, it appears that the Undertaking's conduct is not only capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant but also amounts to the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, which prima facie constitutes violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively;""

 with contradictory witness statements.","The issues for determination identified by the Commission are as follows:
A. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act through the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
B. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(b) of the Act through the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including information which lacks a reasonable basis, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
C. Whether, the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(a) through the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
","We note that during the enquiry as well as during the proceedings before the Commission the Respondent was given substantial time to amend/ revise its trade dress, however, no credible effort was made by the Respondent to change its trade dress and make it distinct from that of the Complainant. Hence, keeping in view the above, we are constrained to impose a penalty of PKR. 5,000,000/- (Rupees Five Million Only) on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
The Respondent is hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behaviour in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to cease and desist from the use of its Trade Dress (previous and revised submitted to the Commission) which is subject matter of this Order and similar to the Complainant's Trade Dress and Trade Mark, with immediate effect and not to use it in future. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's Trade Dress. The Respondent is also directed to file within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene any provision of the Act, in particular Section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondent shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of Section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
In terms of the above, SCN No. 34 /2016 is hereby disposed of.

","ISSUE A: 
According to Section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In simple terms, the mischief that Section 10 seeks to remedy is consumer deception. The Commission has established time and again that the term ""consumer"" is to be construed as the ordinary consumer for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act, reference in this regard is placed on 'in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zong reported as 2010 CLD 1478, wherein the Commission observed that 'restricting its interpretation with the use of the words `average', 'reasonable ' or 'prudent' will not only narrow down and put constraints on the effective implementation of the provision it would rather be contrary to the intent of law.
In its Order dated 8 February 2016 in the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. A Rahim Foods and reported as 2016 CLD 1128, the Commission expounded upon the concept of ""parasitic copying"" being an inherent part of the fraudulent use of another's product labeling and packaging. More specifically, the following explanation of parasitic copying demonstrates aptly the crucial aspects of the practice:
""Indeed parasitic copying typically consists in reproducing the main presentational features of market leading products (such as the shape of the product or of its packaging, color combination and graphic arrangement) but usually there is just enough difference to avoid a clear cut trade mark infringement.
Furthermore, the Commission is guided by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which contains provisions designed to tackle copycat packaging that misleads or confuses consumers. Article (1)(b) of the directive bans, commercial practices misleading consumers in relation to the main characteristics of the product, including its commercial origin. Article (2)(a), which is specifically dedicated to confusing marketing. Guided by the above general principles and adopting a holistic approach, the Commission's observations, on a juxtaposition of the images of the Complainant's Trade Dress and Respondent's Trade Dress are as follows:
i. There is no doubt that a pictorial comparison of the Complainant's Products and Respondent's Products leads to the obvious conclusion that there exist deceptively confusing similarities in the Complainant's Trade Dress and the Respondent's Trade Dress, almost to the extent of being identical but for the different brand names evident on the packaging.
As regards the allegation pertaining to the use of the name ""Shainal"" by the Respondent, it is observed that the same is a derivative of the brand name of two of the oldest market players, the Complainant i.e. ""National"" and ""Shan"". The name ""Shainal"" is a homophone of the brand name ""National"" in general and a combination of the words 'Shan' and National' in specific.
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of Section 10(1) in terms of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act to the extent of the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress.
ISSUE B: 
With respect to this issue, the Commission is required to determine whether the Respondent's copycat packaging of the Complainant's Trade Dress, also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to consumers within the scope of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.
Clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods; constitutes a deceptive marketing practice.
The terms ""misleading"" information has been interpreted by the Commission in the case reported as 2010 CLD 1478, as follows:
Misleading information: ""may essentially include oral or written statements or representations that are: (a) capable of giving wrong impression or idea, (b) likely to lead into error of conduct, thought or judgment, (c) tends to misinform or misguide owing to vagueness or any omission, (d) may or may not be deliberate or conscious, and (e) in contrast to false information, it has less erroneous connotation and is somewhat open to interpretation as the circumstances and conduct of a party may be treated as relevant to a certain extent"".
The Commission now considers the term 'reasonable basis' in light of section 10 of the Act. The concept of having a reasonable basis is an established doctrine in USA which was first recognised in the case of Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972).
In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the aforementioned conduct of the Respondent has resulted in a violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2) (b) of the Act, as the Respondent is disseminating misleading information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis, in the form of the confusing similarities of Respondent's Trade Dress to that of the Complainant's Trade Dress, thereby misleading the consumers as to the origin and place of production of the product.
ISSUE C: 
Clause (a) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information that it is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' shall be deemed to constitute a deceptive marketing practice.
This provision constitutes two main elements (i) the dissemination of false or misleading information (ii) that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking.
With reference to proving the actual harm caused to a competitors business interest, the Commission in its Order in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Jotun Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited reported as 2015 CLD 1638, stated that, actual harm to a competitors business interest need not be established to make out a violation in terms of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, the very presence of a deceptive market practice that has the potential to cause harm to the competitor's business is in fact sufficient to hold the Respondent culpable.
As per the ruling laid down by the Commission in the 2016 CLD 1128, ""in the event that there exists a contravention of Section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out"". Furthermore, as established above, copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, in itself also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to the public as it amounts to an unfair and deceptive trading practice. 
Based on the above, the Commission is of the considered opinion that, Respondent's practice of parasitic copying of the Complainant's Trade Dress, which appreciably impairs the consumer's ability to make an informed decision due to confusing similarities between the Respondent's Products and the Complainant's Products, being inherently deceptive, is in fact capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in contravention of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.",HBT/8/CCOP Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","File No.66/REG/COMP/DHL/CCP/2011, decided on 21st December, 2012.
 ",,,Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the 'Complainant') filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission') against the Respondents. In the complaint it was alleged that the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's stylized and artistically created logo/trademark without the Complainant's permission or authorization or consent. The Commission initiated an enquiry pursuant to section 37(2) of the Act.  with a different defendant.,"In view of the submissions made before us in the subject proceedings, following issues need deliberation:--
 
(i) whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
 
(ii) whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
 
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act,
 
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10, and
 
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
 
","The Respondents of the first category i.e. Mr. Rehan (Respondent No. 1) and ICS Courier (Respondent No. 2) were forthcoming in their conduct as discussed in Paras (36) and (37). Therefore, taking a lenient view, we are not imposing any penalty on both the Respondents; however, they are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in future, which shall otherwise entail serious consequences under the Act.
The Respondent belonging to the second category, i.e. Mr. Uzair, has also provided the documents substantiating that in fact the couriers booked by him were passed on to the Complainant and were eventually sent through the Complainant. He has also provided the details of many other undertakings using the trademark of the Complainant. Although the Respondent has assured the Commission future compliance, it is important that at least some penalty be imposed keeping in view that his practices were misleading and deceptive in terms of section 10. Particularly, the fact that he even represented himself affiliated with the Complainant by using the Complainant's trademark on his visiting card cannot be overlooked being a serious breach. Also, he did not place anything on record to demonstrate that he has discontinued such practices, after the issuance of the show cause notice. Keeping the above in view coupled with his assurance, we are restricting the penalty to Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five hundred Thousand Only).
The Respondents, namely Mr. Asif Iqbal (Respondent No. 4) and Mr. Malik M. Pervaiz Respondent No. 5) have failed in substantiating their stance and have not even demonstrated their good faith through their conduct. The contravention of section 10(1) of the Act stands established in terms of what has already been discussed above. However, we are of the view that the necessary deterrent effect would be achieved and the interests of justice served even if a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only) is imposed.
Similarly, Mr. Nauman Anwer Butt (Respondent No. 6) and Raja Asir Munir (Respondent No. 7), are doing the business in their own names i.e. DHIL and DHS respectively, yet using a logo which is deceptively similar to the Complainant's trademark for which no plausible justification has been placed forward. Based on the principles laid down by the courts in cases of 'passing off' similarity in colour, scheme, get-up, overall similarity and the broad salient features by which an ordinary illiterate customer would be misled for taking product manufactured or services rendered by defendant as that of plaintiff are the relevant factors for such determination. In our considered view in the present case, taking these factors into account we find the Respondents' marks misleading and deceptive and capable of being taken as marks of the Complainant by an ordinary consumer. On comparison these marks bear such resemblance which is likely to cause confusion and deception. It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents. While these Respondents are primarily using their own business names, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 is not relevant. Nonetheless, in the given facts and circumstances, it is in the interest of justice to deter such practices and these Respondents are also held liable to pay a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only).
The Respondents are hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behavior in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to discontinue the use of trademark of the Complainant with immediate effect and not to use it in future without due authorization. The Respondents are also directed to file within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Order, the commitments with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene provisions of section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter, along with the penalty.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondents shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.500,000 (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
 At the end, we cannot ignore the fact that during the proceedings, details of other undertakings along with the images were provided by Mr. Uzair. The Registrar is directed to forward this concern to the OFT department of this Commission for further scrutiny and independent inquiry, if deemed necessary, in terms of section 37 of the Act.
Accordingly, the Show Cause Notices Nos. 26 to 32 of 2012 issued to the Respondents are hereby disposed of in terms of this Order.
","The complaint is filed by Company Secretary Mr. Muhammad Hanif Idrees, with the Complainant's seal and supported by Board Resolution No.12 of 2011, authorizing him and CEO Mr. Sarfaraz Siddiqui to file legal documents regarding the misuse of the DHL trademark.

The complaint is valid, containing the signature of the authorized representative and supported by a power of attorney signed by Mr. Idrees.

The objection that the complaint is not filed by an authorized representative has no merit, as proven by the resolution and signatures provided. The burden of proof that such power did not exist lies on the defendant, who failed to provide contrary evidence.

Some Respondents denied the authenticity of the images in the enquiry report and claimed to have stopped using the DHL trademark. However, these images were verified by an enquiry officer, and Respondents failed to provide rebuttal evidence within the given time.

Respondent Mr. Butt claimed the Complainant encouraged using its trademark, but provided no evidence to substantiate this.

Respondent Mr. Asif Iqbal objected to the complaint, stating it mentioned ""Asir Iqbal,"" who does not work at the site. However, evidence showed ""Asir Iqbal"" was a typographic mistake, and the complaint was indeed against Mr. Asif Iqbal.

The Respondents claimed ignorance of the Competition Act and lack of intent to deceive. However, the Complainant's trademark and logo are globally recognized, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

The essential function of a trademark is to guarantee the origin of goods or services to the consumer, distinguishing them from others. The use of similar logos by the Respondents aimed to capitalize on the Complainant's goodwill, misleading consumers.

The Complainant's trademark is registered in Pakistan and over 220 countries, representing swiftness and speed.

Fraudulent use of the trademark involves misrepresentation to deceive consumers for an advantage, which the Respondents knew or should have known was unauthorized.

The conduct of the Respondents violates section 10(1) of the Act, with varying penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and the conduct of the Respondents.

Respondents Mr. Rehan and ICS Courier, who discontinued using the trademark promptly, are not penalized but are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in the future.

","Civil Petition No. 1496-K of 2021, decided on 27th April, 2023.
(Against judgment dated 15.7.2021 passed by the High Court of Sindh at Karachi in M.A. No. 10 of 2004)
","27th April, 2023.","MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR, J.","According to the chronicles of the subject matter, the petitioner has been a manufacturer of tooth brushes and hair brushes in Pakistan since 1983 and allegedly improved and enhanced the quality of its products and now holds a position in the market with the trade mark ""TRISA"" in Class No. 21 under Trade Mark No. 86913 which was registered on 14.07.1985 for tooth brushes, nail brushes, shaving brushes and hair brushes. It is further alleged that the respondent No.1 has no right to the petitioner's registered trade mark but it was trying to usurp the trade mark ""TRISA"". Due to such illegal actions, the petitioner filed Civil Suit No.863/1997 in the Sindh High Court and obtained an injunctive order on 10.03.1999 against which the respondent No.1 preferred H.C.A. No. 83/1999, however the HCA was disposed off by consent on 09.08.2005 without modifying or setting aside the aforesaid injunctive order. The respondent No. 1 filed an application for registration of trade mark in Class-21 in respect of household or kitchen utensils and other articles including brushes (except paint brushes). According to section 15(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 read with Rule 30 of the Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963, (""Revised Rules 1963""), a time-limit of two months is prescribed for filing opposition (Form TM-55) from the date of publication of advertisement in the Trade Mark Journal. The petitioner sought time to file TM-55 i.e. opposition to the registration of the respondent No.1's alleged trademark, and the Registrar of Trade Marks, after hearing the petitioner and the respondent No.1, passed a decision on 18.08.2003 allowing the petitioner's request for extension of time to file opposition and condoned the delay of 108 days. The respondent No. 1 challenged the aforesaid decision in the High Court by dint of M.A. No. 10/2004 and vide the impugned judgment the appeal was allowed and the decision dated 18.08.2003 passed by the Registrar, Trade Marks was set aside. with new evidence presented.","The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the impugned judgment has been passed without appreciating the law and the rules applicable. It was further averred that the learned Single Judge failed to consider that there is no vested right in procedure. He further contended that the decision of Registrar was based on the premise that the petitioner was never issued or received a notice prior to the publication of the respondent No.1's application as the search was not carried out properly under Rule 23 of the Revised Rules, 1963. It was further avowed that it is a settled rule of interpretation that no one has a vested right in procedure, coupled with the principle that, since no penal consequences have been prescribed in Rule 30 of the Revised Rules 1963, the same cannot be treated as mandatory. It was submitted that the use of the word ""shall"" does not make Rule 30 mandatory or the time prescribed therein unimpeachable, more so when Rule 76 of the Revised Rules 1963 grant a special jurisdiction to the Registrar of Trade Marks to extend time for doing any act or taking any proceeding under the Revised Rules 1963, subject to satisfaction of the Registrar on proper justification. He further contended that the learned Single Judge failed to appreciate that the Registrar of Trade Marks could exercise his authority based on objective criteria at his discretion and satisfaction and the facts of this case fully justified the grant of extension.","Heard the arguments. There is no dispute or disagreement between the parties that all four separate requests for extension of time (TM-55) were sent on same date (i.e. on 11.3.2003) and were late by 108 days. The Registrar Trade Marks condoned the delay of 108 days and the Notice of opposition (TM-55) was brought on record. According to section 15 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, opposition to the registration of a trade mark may be filed when an application for registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, and the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted to be advertised in the prescribed manner, and compliant with sub section (2), any person may, within the prescribed time from the date of advertisement of an application, give notice in writing in the prescribed manner to the Registrar for opposition to the registration and, in line with subsection (3), the Registrar is obligated to serve a copy of the notice on the applicant in the prescribed manner, and, within the prescribed time, the applicant shall send to the Registrar, in the prescribed manner, a counter-statement of the grounds on which he relies for his application and, if he does not do so, he shall be deemed to have abandoned his application.","The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 argued that the application for registration of the Trade Mark was submitted on 23.04.1997 after complying with all requisite formalities advertised in Trade Mark Journal No.598 for the month of November 2000, so any person could oppose the registration by filing a notice of opposition within the stipulated period of two months from the date of advertisement as provided in the Revised Rules 1963, but no opposition was filed till 10.03.2003 despite the fact that the statutory period of two months expired on 22.11.2002 and no request for extension was filed by the petitioner. However, on 11.03.2003, the petitioner at one time filed four applications for extension in time which were heard by the Registrar together and, after the hearing, the Registrar Trade Marks through decision dated 18.08.2003 condoned the delay of 108 days without any lawful justification and said action was in violation of the powers vested in the Registrar for exercising the discretion of granting an extension of time which should have been based on concrete and justifiable grounds rather than in a slipshod manner. The learned counsel further argued that the learned High Court has considered all the aspects of the case in a proper manner and rightly set aside the decision of Registrar which was based on an incorrect exposition of law.","In view of the above discussion, we do not find any illegality or perversity in the impugned judgment passed by the learned Sindh High Court. Consequently, this petition is dismissed and leave is refused.",Dismissed.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 64 of 2017, decided on 12th January, 2018.","27th November, 2017","MRS. ASHRAF JAHAN, J.","The facts leading to the present appeal as per case of the Appellant are that they are proprietor of ""Moonlite Trading Company"", (hereinafter referred to as (""the Appellant Company""), which is a merchant, importer and marketer of self-designed consumer goods and other items. Since last several decades the Appellant Company is carrying the business of merchant and import of consumer goods including lotions, toiletries, perfumes, deodorants, air-fresheners, diapers and insecticides in Pakistan. The products imported by the Appellant Company are being marketed and sold under various Trade Marks, which include Cobra, Lotion Cobra, Soft Touch, Ku Ku, Lotion Saffire, Mascot, etc. They have also developed distinctive designs, logos or artwork for use in connection with the aforesaid brands including Appellant's current and long standing Trade Mark ""COBRA"". Therefore, in its pursuance, the Appellant Company obtained registration of the Trade Mark ""COBRA"" under Registration No.99323 in international class 05 since 11.08.1988 under the Ordinance, 2001, which registration is valid and intact for all intents and purposes till today. In order to further strengthen its proprietorship, the Appellant either directly or through their company has also secured copyright registration under the Copyright Ordinance, 1962. The Appellant's product bearing ""COBRA"" has been and continued to be sold and promoted extensively throughout Pakistan since year 1988 without any hindrance from any quarter and thus they had invested substantial amount in the promotion and publicity of the product bearing ""COBRA"" mark and therefore, the Appellant company enjoys an enviable reputation and goodwill in the said Trade Mark in Pakistan.
It is further the case of the Appellant that on or about 31.03.2010, Respondent No.2 applied for the Registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", which was accepted for publication in the Trade Mark Journal in order to invite Opposition and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 733 in the month of February, 2012. Immediately upon becoming aware of such publication, the Appellant filed a Notice of Opposition bearing Opposition No.455/2013 against the grant of Registration of Mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" on the ground, inter alia, that the Trade Mark applied for is identical to the Appellant's trade mark ""COBRA"" and is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the consumers. In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Opposition, Respondent No.2 filed its counter statement contending that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was adopted in 2009 in order to distinguish its goods from other competitors and Notice of Opposition is liable to be dismissed on the ground that the mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is quite distinguishable from the Appellant's mark ""COBRA"", thus, qualifies for registration.
Subsequently, in January, 2014 it came to the Appellant's knowledge that Respondent No.2 in connivance with others had commenced their illegal activities of importing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and selling their goods in Karachi under the name and style of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", therefore, immediately upon becoming aware of such illegal activities, the Appellant filed Suit No.192/2014 against Respondent No.2 for infringement of rights, passing off, unfair competition, declaration and permanent injunction. In these proceedings vide order dated 03.02.2014 interim injunction was also passed, restraining Respondent No.2 from using mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". During the pendency of above suit and proceedings in Opposition No.455/2013, Appellant came to know that Respondent No.2 in the present appeal illegally obtained Trade Mark Registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", thereafter a detailed order was passed on 06.06.2014 in Suit No.192/2014, whereby the Appellant was required to file an application for invalidation of registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"". Meanwhile, Respondent No.2 filed H.C.A. No.220/2014 against the order dated 06.06.2014 passed by the Single Bench in Suit No.192/2014 and the said order of Single Judge was suspended by the Division Bench vide its order dated 25.09.2014. The appeal was dismissed and the matter was remanded to the learned Single Judge to decide the injunction application in Suit No.192/2014. On 13.03.2017, an order was passed, whereby the registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" was held as null and void and Respondent No.1 was directed to proceed with Opposition No.455/2013 and to pass a speaking order within thirty days. As a result thereof, the cancellation of the illegal registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing application No.280917 in class 5 was confirmed in Trade Marks Journal No.794 dated 01.03.2017. Opposition No.455/2013 came up for final hearing on 04.05.2017 before Respondent No.1 and subsequently on 10.08.2017 short order dated 07.08.2017 was communicated to the Appellant, disallowing the Opposition of the Appellant and allowing the application bearing No.280917 in class 5 of Respondent No.2 to proceed with registration with the disclaimer of word ""Cobra"" and all descriptive words/letters/device appearing on the label.
As the above order was received to the Appellant on 10.08.2017, they applied for certified copy of the decision, but the same was not communicated, hence they filed appeal only on the basis of short order communicated to them. However, subsequently, in compliance of Court's order dated 20.11.2017 detailed order was supplied to the parties, which is impugned by way of present appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed Counter Affidavit to this appeal and denied all the allegations/averments/statements made in the memorandum of titled appeal and supported the impugned order.
 with contradictory witness statements.","It is contended by learned counsel for the Appellant that the impugned order has been passed, ignoring the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the provisions of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; in particular section 17 of the Ordinance, 2001 has been wrongly applied by Respondent No.1 while passing the order. Per learned counsel, the product bearing mark ""COBRA"" continued to be in use in Pakistan by the present Appellant since 1987 and the Appellant is the proprietor of the mark ""COBRA"" bearing Registration Nos.99323 and 106208 in classes 5 and 16 respectively; the earliest registration was obtained in the year 1988. The Respondent No.1 for arriving at the decision in respect of Opposition No.455/2013 has ignored and misconstrued the orders dated 13.02.2017, 20.02.2017 and 13.03.2017 passed by this Court in J.M. No.34/2014, wherein learned Judge clearly observed in the order that the trade mark registration was nearly identical, therefore, was in violation of the trade mark laws. This being the position, impugned decision passed by Respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
On the other hand, it is contended by learned counsel for Respondent No.2 that Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of import and for its products of insecticides had used trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", since year 2009. Per learned counsel, the Respondent's products under the Ordinance, 2001 referred to above are sold in Pakistan since 2009 onwards and expenditure of millions of rupees is incurred upon the advertisement of such products and it was well in knowledge of the Appellant since 2009, but they remained silent; neither objected nor otherwise filed any suit to restrain Respondent No.2 from using trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" and it is only in the month of February, 2014 after a delay of almost five years, they filed Suit No.192/2014 and obtained ex parte ad-interim injunction order in the suit, whereby Respondent No.2 was restrained from using its proprietor trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"".",For the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of Respondent No.1 is set aside and the Opposition No.455/2013 filed by the appellant is allowed. The application of Respondent No.2 bearing No.280917 is rejected.,"It is contended by learned counsel that the word ""COBRA"" per se is descriptive, suggestive and common to trade in relation to insecticides and herbicides; therefore, provisions of section 17 subject to provision of section 14 of the Ordinance, 2001 are not applicable to the present case. They have got only registered their label and have not obtained any registration for the word ""COBRA"". Presently a larger number of competitors of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 are selling their insect killing products in various parts of the world including Pakistan using descriptive, suggestive and common to trade word ""COBRA"" and no confusion and deception has been caused to any person, therefore, in the light of above factual and legal position, Respondent No.1 has rightly passed the order, which has been impugned before this Court with wrong perception and ulterior motives. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following case law:
2013 CLD 330 (Tillotts Pharma AG v. GETZ Pharma (Private) Limited.)
1989 SCMR 361 (Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd.)
2007 CLD 991 (Messrs Master Textile Mills Ltd. v. Master Fabrics)
2007 CLD 997 (Abid Aziz Khan and 2 others v. Bank of Punjab).
Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 submitted that the order passed by Respondent No.1 has been passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the impugned order is valid and needs no interference at this stage.
Reasoning and Analysis
I have considered the arguments advanced before me by both the sides and have perused the case record.
To commence with, the material placed on record shows that so far as the claim of the Appellant as regards registration of trade mark ""COBRA"" and its prior use, disclosed in paragraphs two to five of the memo of appeal is concerned, it is an undeniable reality established on record; therefore, it needs no further discussion. Moreover, from the contents of earlier order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34/2014 it is also established that earlier certificate for registration of ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" bearing No.138268 dated 24.02.2014 in relation to trade mark No.280917 was issued by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 in blatant violation of the scheme of trade mark laws and thus declared null and void, which position was conceded before the Court by Respondent No.1 and not much disputed by Respondent No.2. In this background now it is to be seen that how far the subsequent impugned order dated 07.08.2017 passed by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondent No.2 once again affirming the earlier stance (reasons recorded on 20.09.2017) is legal and within the frame work of the Ordinance, 2001. In this context firstly it is to be noted that purported prior use of trade mark ""COBRA"" by Respondent No.2 on the strength of earlier order of Respondent No.1, which was set aside by this Court vide order dated 13.03.2017 in J.M.No.34 of 2014 was nullity and void thus such period could not be considered by the Respondent No.1 as valid ground to justify the subsequent impugned order; observations of Respondent No.1 for this purpose are therefore ill-founded and perverse. Based on these facts there is no difficulty for me to hold that on one side the claim of Appellant regarding registration and use of trade mark ""COBRA"" is fully established and on the other side the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for registration of trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in the same category of goods is on weak footings, unless the Respondent No.2 could satisfy that use of prefix 'faster black' in their label before ""COBRA"" is sufficient to dislodge the opposition No.455 of 2013 filed by the Appellant. I have called for the samples of both the respective products from the learned counsel for the appellant and Respondent No.2 and by placing them in juxtaposition carefully examined the same, with reference to labels of ""COBRA"" and ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"", and also the package material, size, shape, colour scheme and overall printed text. For ready reference their picture is placed below, which depicts similarities in the two products, sufficient to cause confusion among the ordinary customers.
The main guiding principle to examine the genuineness of the subsequent claim of Respondent No.2 for the registration of its trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" is that upon comparison of the two, the Court is to be satisfied that there are sufficient features to differentiate between the two trade marks phonetically as well as visually, so that an unwary buyer of the same product, as in the instant matter, is genuinely not confused and misguided due to the feature of similarities between the two. In my considered opinion, the concept of totality of impression, test of average consumer etc. recorded by the Respondent No.1 in its order dated 20.09.2017 is misconceived and erroneous. As observed by me there are sound reasons disclosed by the Appellant in his Opposition No.455/2013, which justify grant of such opposition and consequent rejection of Application of 280917 in class 5 of registration of Trade mark ""FASTER BLACK COBRA"" in favour of Respondent No.2. This view of the matter is supported from the following judgments of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which are of binding nature:
PLD 1984 Supreme Court 8 (Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another).
PLD 1990 Supreme Court 313 (Seven-Up Company v. Kohinoor Thread Ball Factory and 3 others).

He contends that there is no issue of authorization of agency but in instant suit issue of trade mark is involved. He also refers section 73, subsection (3) of sections 80, 86 and 96 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. It is also contended that defendants 2 and 3 have not sought permission to run their business in Pakistan hence their application is without any substance and grounds taken in their application, are not falling within the parameters of section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. He relied upon PLD 2000 Karachi 139, 2007 CLC 1610 and 2003 PLC 26.
In contra, learned counsel for defendants Nos.2 and 3 contends that plaintiff was agent of defendants Nos.2 and 3 up-to 2009/2010 and thereafter on same trade mark he got registration in Pakistan hence under Paris Convention of Intellectual Property, 1833 rights of the defendants are protected; while referring emails and documents submitted with counter affidavit emphasis that plaintiff was their agent and continuously remained in contact with defendants with regard to such business. with an additional plaintiff.","Since name and style of trade mark is not disputed but question, before this Court as raised by respective parties, appears to be confined to the extent of registration of same trade mark in Pakistan in favour of plaintiff with reference to 'Paris convention' and applicability thereof within object of Chapter-X of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. A proper respond to the issue, would require a reference to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of the plaint which are as under:-
That defendant No.3 is a company carrying on business at California, U.S.A. It gets the batteries and battery cells manufactured from the Peoples Republic of China & Vietnam and import them to the U.S.A. The batteries and battery cells are labeled under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label and thereafter they are shipped to Pakistan. The goods were also shipped from Republic of China & Vietnam to Pakistan. The plaintiff was carrying on business with it and was their representative in Pakistan until the year 2009-2010.
That thereafter the relations between them became strained and the defendant No.3 started exporting its goods to defendants Nos. 1 and 2 under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label.
That the marks POWER SONIC Label of the plaintiff and POWER SONIC Label of the defendants are identical with each other, visually as well as phonetically. Besides this, the design, get up and colour scheme of both the marks are identical, thus causing confusion and deception during the course of trade.
From bare reading of the above paragraphs of the pleadings of the plaintiff himself (itself) following facts are prima facie admitted i.e.:
i) defendant No.3 continuously has been exporting its product under marks 'POWER SONIC' from California etc.;
ii) plaintiff has been in active knowledge and notice that defendant No.1 is carrying its business under such mark;
iii) plaintiff has been selling product of the defendant No.1 as 'agent' of defendant No.3;
iv) mark of plaintiff, though got registered, is identical to that of defendant No.3 with each other visually as well as phonetically;","It is quite safe to say that no prima facie case or balance of convenience is available to the plaintiff, rather application, so filed by the plaintiff, is devoid of substance which accordingly is dismissed. On the other hand since, the mark of the defendant No.3 is 'well known mark in Pakistan', and is protected by Chapter-X of the Ordinance hence application of the defendant No.3 is allowed which otherwise is within scope and object of section 86(3). However, plaintiff is at liberty to approach Registrar for fresh registration of its independent mark.
","It is safe to say that it is not disputed that plaintiff was agent of defendants with regard to same business and even under the trade mark ""Power Sonic"" labels he was carrying out by receiving shipments. Now, to examine the applicability of Chapter-X of the Ordinance would require reference to sections 85, 86 and 92 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The owner of a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention as a well-known trade mark shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Pakistan of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical or deceptively similar to the well-known trade mark-
(a) in relation to identical or similar goods or services, where the use is likely to cause confusion; or
(b) where such use causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the well-know trade mark.
(4) Rights conferred under subsection (3) shall be subject to the provisions of section 81 and nothing in the said subsection shall effect the continuation of any bona fide use of a trade mark begun before the commencement of this Ordinance.
Trade name.---A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not.
Perusal of section 85 categorical suggests that Pakistan is the signatory of Paris Convention and is a Convention country. Definition of ""Paris Convention"" means that ""Paris convention for the protection of industrial property of the 20th March, 1833"". The 'Paris convention' was also a step to ensure protection to 'well-known marks' in all signatory countries even if they (trade-marks) are not literally registered in all countries. The inclusion of Chapter-X in the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is itself an admission to vitality of such aspect particularly when it assures protection but to 'well known marks'. At this juncture, I would insist that the bare reading of the section 86(1)(b), in existence of admitted positions, is sufficient to bring the mark of the defendant No.3 as 'well known in Pakistan'. Once it is prima facie established that a 'mark' is qualifying the meaning of 'well-known in Pakistan' it shall be entitled to all protections 'available to such 'mark'. Since name and style is not disputed and question of registration is categorically defined in section 92 with regard to trade name, which provides that ""A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not."" I am equally conscious with object of the Section 90 of the Ordinance but such plea is not taken by the plaintiff that plaintiff got the registration of mark of defendant No.3 in his (plaintiff's) favour within notice and knowledge of the defendant No.3 or that defendant No.3 has acquiesced such registration of its 'mark' in favour of the plaintiff. On the other hand, the plaintiff himself admitted that on becoming relations strained between plaintiff and defendant No.3, the defendant No.3 started shipping its product to defendants Nos.1 and 2. Needless to add that even while resorting to procedure of section 90, the plaintiff was legally required to have made this fact clear within notice and knowledge of the 'Registrar' so as to allow an opportunity of hearing to defendant No.3 to oppose such registration of its mark because the provision of section 90(a) leaves the Registrar with no discretion to register such 'mark' where proprietor opposes such registration. The admission of plaintiff that defendant No.3 has been continuing its business under same mark is sufficient to indicate its intention to enjoy privileges, available to such mark, under Convention of 1833. At this moment, it would be noteworthy to add here that if such practice is allowed then in every country any agent or other person would start that practice by getting registration from that area by taking the benefits of goodwill attached with such well-known mark. If so, it would mean nothing but a negation of the Convention which otherwise provides protection to the creator and such scheme as enshrined is to save the rights of intellectual property. Not only this but such agent shall become entitled to the fruits of the name and good-will attached with such 'mark' which cannot be allowed to happen because the name and good-will are not earned/established over-nights by mere preparing a product alone but the efforts and finance which make that 'mark' to stand in the market with its own name.",MH/J-16/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","Suit Nos.1461 and 1584 of 2013, decided on 19th January, 2015.",,,"IMC and Axact represent two large business houses, the former being part of the well known Jang/Geo group while the latter (on its own showing) is engaged in the information technology (IT) business and now intends to move into the multi-media world of broadcast by way of television, print and digital media and entertainment. Classes 38 and 41 relate to services, the former encompassing telecommunication services while the latter relates to ""education, providing of training, entertainment, sporting and cultural activities"". IMC claims to be the proprietor of ""Bol"" as a registered trademark in class 41. Its case is that it was entered on the Register of Trade Marks as the proprietor of the mark on or about 7-11-2013 on its application No. 238904, which was filed on 11-6-2007. It claims to have another application No. 195773 pending for registration of ""Bol"" as a trademark in class 38. That application appears to have been filed on or about 15-5-2004. There is apparently another application, 342080, that IMC has pending for registration of ""Bol"" in class 38, though this application was filed many years later (on or about 19-6-2013). Be that as it may, IMC's grievance is that Axact intends to use and/or has started using ""Bol"" in a manner that infringes its registered trademark (in terms of the aforementioned -application No. 238904). Suit 1461 of 2013 is therefore essentially a straightforward suit for trademark infringement. C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 has been filed therein to restrain Axact from infringing the aforesaid trademark. The suit was filed on 19-11-2013 and the said application came up before me on the same day, when I made an ad interim order. That order continues to remain in the field.
Axact strongly contests IMC's claim. Its case is that it is entitled to have ""Bol"" registered as a trademark in terms as stated above, for which it has as many as 156 applications pending in various classes. Axact's case is that there is in fact no such registration and that IMC has forged, fabricated and manipulated the official record to claim a right which it does not have and to which it is not entitled. More precisely, its case is that application No. 238904 on the basis of which IMC claims its registered trademark was not made in relation to ""Bol"" at all but rather in respect of an altogether different mark. However, subsequently the record was manipulated and fabricated to show that IMC had a registered trademark. y this application, Axact seeks interim injunctive relief to restrain IMC from claiming to be the ""owner/proprietor/applicant"" for registration of ""Bol"" and for it to be restrained from pursuing the three applications mentioned above, i.e., application Nos. 238904, 195773 and 342080. The second application filed by Axact was C.M.A. 13904 of 2013. By this application Axact sought an order that the Nazir of the Court take the entire record in relation to application Nos. 238904 and 195773 in his custody. The said application was allowed by a learned single Judge on 13-12-2013. 
 under heightened security.","The principal contest between IMC and Axact over the use and registration of the word ""Bol"" as a trademark in classes 38 and 41.
Whether IMC's application No. 238904 for ""Bol"" as a registered trademark was valid and properly registered.
Whether Axact's allegations of forgery, fabrication, and manipulation of the official record by IMC have merit.
The legality and validity of the certificate of registration of ""Bol"" relied upon by IMC.
The propriety of the Registrar's routine practice of advertising applications before acceptance.","Subject to, and in terms of, what has been stated herein above, both C.M.A. 12775 of 2013 in Suit 1461 of 2013 and C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 in Suit 1584 of 2013 are dismissed.","A certificate purporting to be issued under the hand of the Registrar as to any entry, matter or thing that he is authorised by this Ordinance or the rules to make or do shall be prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and of the contents thereof, or of the matter or thing having been done or not done.
Registration.---(1) Where an application has been accepted and (a) no notice of opposition has been given within the period referred to in subsection (2) of section 28 ... the Registrar shall, within such period as may be prescribed, register the trade mark, unless it appears to him having regard to matters coming to his notice since he accepted the application that it was accepted in error.
On the registration of a trade mark the Registrar shall publish the registration in the prescribed manner and issue to the applicant a certificate in the prescribed form of registration, sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.
Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity.---In all legal proceedings relation to a trade mark registered under this Ordinance ... the fact that a person is registered as proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmission thereof.
if no opposition is filed to the mark as advertised within the stipulated period (or no application is made, within the said period, for extension of time) to make an entry on the Register in the prescribed manner (section 33(1)). Such entry is prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration of the mark in favor of the applicant as the proprietor thereof (section 43). Once the entry has been made the Registrar is bound to issue an appropriate certificate to the applicant under the seal of the Trade Marks Registry (section 33(4)). Such certificate is prima facie evidence of the entry having been made and the contents thereof (section 11). In a suit for infringement of a registered trademark when such a certificate is produced, in the normal course it has the effect as just stated. This may be only on a prima there basis but that, after all, is all that is required for an application for interim injunctive relief. 
In my view, given that the certificate relied upon is not issued by the Registrar himself, the position adopted by the official defendants in the Written Statement must be given primacy. The position there is that no certificate ""duly signed and stamped by the competent authority"" has been issued. Furthermore, I note that in the Written Statement, the official defendants have avoided stating that, in fact, ""Bol"" is properly registered as a trademark in favor of IMC in class 41 on the Register. The certificate must be issued by the Registrar or by an officer of the Registry authorized in terms of section 7(2). Mrs. Nasreen Akhtar was obviously not the Registrar and from what has been said in para 18 of the Written Statement, not authorized to issue the certificate. On any view of the matter therefore, the stance of the official defendants is clear; there is no certificate of or evidencing, registration in the field as has, or can have, legal validity. Indeed, section 11(1) appears to suggest that this is all the evidence that is required. Therefore, if such certificate, as presented by the plaintiff, is categorically denied by the Registrar, then the effect of such denial is clear: there is no prima facie basis on which it can be concluded that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark claimed. 
Sections 27 and 28 of the 2001 Ordinance, as presently relevant. Section 27 requires is that if, after examination of the application and the required search, the Registrar is of the view 'that there are any objections to the application, he must notify the applicant and give him an opportunity to either satisfy the Registrar that the application is, in fact and law, compliant with statutory requirements or to amend it suitably to bring it in line with what is required and permissible. If either of these eventualities is not met, then the Registrar must refuse to accept the application. 
Opposition to registration---(1) When an application far registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted, to be advertised in the prescribed manner:
Provided that the Registrar may cause an application to be advertised before acceptance if it relates to a trade mark to which clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 6 applies, or in any other case where it appears to him that it is expedient by reason of any exceptional circumstances so to do, and where an application has been so advertised the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, advertise it again when it has been accepted, but shall not be bound so to do. It will be seen that this provision was similar to section 28(1). (Section 14 of the previous Act was similar to the present section 27.) There are however two important differences. Firstly, the proviso to section 15(1) comprised of two parts. It could be invoked either (a) in respect of a mark to which section 6(1)(e) of the 1940 Act applied or (b) in any other case where ""exceptional circumstances"" were found to exist. The first proviso to section 28(1) only applies if ""exceptional circumstances"" exist and not otherwise. Secondly, the second proviso to section 28(1) is new: it had no equivalent in the 1940 Act. Now, section 6 of the 1940 Act provided for the distinctiveness that was required of a mark for it to be registered. Subsection (1) provided that a mark would not be registered unless it consisted of any one of the ""essential particulars"" as stated in clauses (a) to (e) thereof.
under the 1940 Act a practice may have arisen that in respect of all applications in which section 6(1)(e) applied to the mark sought to be registered, the Registrar routinely allowed the application to be advertised before acceptance. Once the 2001 Ordinance came into effect, this practice has continued, essentially as a holdover from what was happening previously. However, if so (and even otherwise), in my view such a practice and the routine application of the first proviso under section 28(1) is clearly contrary to law. This is so because the first proviso can apply if, and only if, ""exceptional circumstances"" are shown to exist and not otherwise. This requirement applies to all cases and there is no separate category as was to be found in the proviso to section 15(1). Now, ""exceptional circumstances"" are precisely that: circumstances of such a rare or unusual nature as would warrant departure from the main rule, namely that an application is only to be advertised if accepted. 
I turn to the second proviso to section 28(1) which is mandatory. he manner in which the Registrar is to ""simultaneously notify"" the ""exceptional circumstances"" which led him to allow advertisement before acceptance can only be for such circumstances to be stated in the advertisement itself. While this follows ineluctably from the language of the second proviso, the point is expressly made in Rule 29 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004. Sub-rule (1) lists the particulars that must go in the advertisement and clause (i) thereof requires that the ""details of special circumstances, if any, under the proviso to subsection (1) of section 28"" must be given.
I conclude that at present IMC has failed to make out a prima facie case that it is the proprietor of the registered trademark ""Bol"" in class 41 on its application No. 238904. Accordingly, its present application is Suit 1461 of 2013, C.M.A. 12775 of 2013, must necessarily fail. Subject to what is stated hereafter, this application is therefore dismissed and the ad interim order made earlier stands recalled and vacated. As noted above, the official defendants have indicated that there is some inquiry ongoing at the Registry with regard to IMC's various applications and in particular application No. 238904. Taking up this application I direct that the official defendants must conclude such inquiry (if not already completed) within 30 days from the date of announcement of this Order. No opportunity of hearing need be given to either IMC or Axact (or any other person) but the results of the inquiry and the report thereon must be provided to them, and a copy of the same placed on the record in both Suits. In particular the report must address and record a clear finding whether, on IMC's application No.238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark. If the finding is that there is no such entry, then IMC's application No. 238904 shall be deemed pending. Since it was advertised under the first proviso in a manner contrary to law, the Registrar must then consider whether the application is to be accepted in terms as required by section 27 read with any other applicable provisions. If accepted (either absolutely or conditionally) then the application must be re-advertised and Axact (and any other person) shall then be entitled to file opposition on such re-advertisement in accordance with law. In its opposition, Axact will be entitled to take all such grounds as are admissible including the ground (as appears to be its case) that the application has been unlawfully allowed to be amended in violation of the first proviso to section 27(7). On the other hand, if the finding recorded in the inquiry is that on IMC's application No. 238904, an entry has in fact been lawfully and properly made in the Register showing IMC as the registered proprietor of the ""Bol"" trademark, then the date of such finding or the date of this Order (whichever is later) shall be deemed to be the date of the decision of the Registrar and the date on which the trademark is, in fact, registered. Axact will be entitled to its statutory remedies, if any, accordingly. Furthermore, in such a situation IMC shall be entitled to renew its application for interim injunctive relief in Suit 1461 of 2013 which, if filed, will be taken up and decided on its own merits.
I turn to Axact's application C.M.A. 13905/2013 in its Suit 1584 of 2013. I can see no reason why this application should be allowed. As already noted in respect of application No. 195773, the same has been advertised and is being opposed by Axact. Application No. 342080 is still under examination at the Registry and will be dealt with in accordance with law, especially as explained herein above. The third application, No. 238904, has already been dealt with herein above. Since all the applications can be, and will be, dealt with under the relevant provisions of the 2001 Ordinance, I see no reason why an interim injunctive order should be made in relation thereto in terms as sought. Subject to what has been stated herein before, C.M.A. 13905 of 2013 is therefore dismissed.
In order to enable further proceedings to be taken, both in terms as stated herein above and under the 2001 Ordinance, the Nazir is directed to return the record taken by him in custody under the order made in Suit 1584 of 2013. However, before doing so he must suitably endorse/mark each page for identification purposes and retain a copy of the record so endorsed/marked and provide copies of the same to IMC and Axact. The record will be handed over to an officer not below the rank of Deputy Registrar who must be authorized in this regard by the Registrar himself. The Registrar must provide, on a monthly basis, copies (suitably marked and under an appropriate letter of intimation) to the Nazir of all documents subsequently filed in the record being returned and printouts of any computer entries made, amended, varied or deleted (whether in respect of the Register or otherwise). The Nazir will keep such copies along with the earlier copy.
I note from the file of Suit 1461 of 2013 that Axact has certain applications pending under Order VII, Rule 11 and section 10, C.P.C. on account of the Lahore suit. These applications may be listed and be heard and disposed of on their own merits notwithstanding what has been stated in the foregoing. I may also note that whatever has been said herein above is tentative in nature and the two Suits, should they go to trial, will be disposed of on their own merits and in terms of the evidence as recorded.
Finally, the Registrar is directed, since the matter is of importance and general application and interest, that paras 13 to 19 of this Order (both inclusive) and this para (and only these paras) must be published in the next issue of the Trade Marks Journal as is published on or after 15 days from the date of announcement of this Order. A copy of the relevant issue of the Journal must be sent to the Additional Registrar (OS), who will ensure that it is placed on the file of Suit 1461 of 2013.

Messrs DHL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED and 2 others---Respondents

","Appeals Nos. 1 and 2 of 2013, decided on 23rd May, 2017.",,"AHMED OWAIS PIRZADA, MEMBER TECHNICAL.","Briefly the background of the appeals is that the Competition Commission of Pakistan received a complaint from respondent No. 1, alleging fraudulent use of its stylized and artistically created logo trademark by the appellants without any permission or authorization or consent of the respondent, which being false, deceptive and misleading and also capable of harming its business was in violation to the provision of section 10 of the Act. The Commission conducted an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Act, concluding that both the appellants used the logo, which were identical in colour and style of the complainant's trademark on the bill board/hording/sign board for advertisement, which prima facie gave an impression that the appellants were authorized dealers of the complainant, which was not correct impression, hence such use of mark which was identical to the respondent's trademark, prima facie was misleading the consumer and was also capable of harming the business interest of the respondent in violation of section 10 of the Act. The report recommended that the conduct of the appellants warranted initiation of proceedings against them under section 30 of the Act.
3. Based on the prima facie findings of the inquiry report, show cause notices were issued to the appellants on 22nd February, 2012, pursuance to which appellants and all other parties were afforded an opportunity of a detailed hearing. Finally the Competition Commission of Pakistan concluded that the manner in which marks under question were printed and advertised look deceptively similar to that of respondent's trademark. Consequently the appellants were penalized vide order dated 21st December, 2012 which had been impugned in the instant appeals.
4. In their appeals the appellants stated that the impugned order dated 21st December, 2012, passed by Competition Commission of Pakistan was illegal, against the law and facts of the case on record and passed arbitrarily. It was stated that neither font, colour did have any resemblance with the respondent's trademark nor style has any similarity with the styled trademark of the respondent. It was further stated that the impugned order was without jurisdiction and not sustainable in the eyes of law. The appellants stated in their appeals that the inquiry report and even the order passed had failed to bear out any misleading information being passed by the appellants or any impression which was basically different from actual one, in clear term there was no deception in using the word IDHS international couriers. The appellants stated in their appeals that from the plain language of section 10(b) of the Competition Act, it was apparent that the lawmakers divided the allegation in to distribution of false or misleading information and distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis related to character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or quality of goods while in the instant case there is no distribution of any false or misleading information and no such information was passed on to the customers regarding the DHL World Wide Express, which affected the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or concern the qualities of goods. The appellants took the position that the complaint was not properly instituted, signed and verified by the competent and authorized person. PLD 1971 Supreme Court page 550 was referred in this behalf. Further, the complaint, which was filed with wrong name of the appellant's company, was not having affidavit with it before the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It was stated that the appellants were neither using the trademark nor distributing false or misleading information regarding the fact that the appellants were authorized/permitted by the respondent. It was further stated that very important questions of law and facts were involved in the matter which could not be adjudicated upon without recording the evidence of both the parties. The pleadings were itself not evidence, it should be proved after recording evidence which was not brought on record.
5. Learned counsel for IDHS while reiterating the position taken in the appeal stated that ""IDHS international couriers"" was a trademark having trademark No-333053 and applied copy right registration with the concerned department. The trademark authority and the copy right authority under the relevant legislation has power upon the case where DHL World Wide Express registered its trademark and copyrights, therefore, the order in the given circumstances was without jurisdiction. Learned counsel further stated that the appellant never accepted, received, dispatched or delivered the goods with the name of respondent. The appellant never presented himself as agent, distributor or employee of the respondent. The learned counsel further stated that the appellant neither developed a web page, letter head, visiting cards, pamphlets, brushers, leaflets, booklets, e-mail ID by the name of respondent nor found in any correspondence or communications with the name of respondent with any third party. Thus the inquiry report, show cause notice and the subsequent order is without any basis lacking material evidence and liable to be set aside in the interest of justice.
 due to a change in law.","After completing the aforesaid exercise we are of the view that the following issues are to be examined for orders.
(i) Whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
(ii) Whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 and
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
(iii) Whether the order of the Competition Commission is bad in the eyes of law.
","In the circumstances, after analyzing the relevant facts and material available on record, we have come to the conclusion that finding recorded by Competition Commission of Pakistan are based on proper appraisal of relevant provisions of Competition Law as well as other material brought on record. The same are, therefore, maintained.
The appeals of the appellants, therefore, being devoid of merits are dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

 
","The issue that whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person has thoroughly been examined by the Competition Commission of Pakistan, however since the same has again been raised by the appellants, therefore, we have also looked into it. The perusal of record reveals that Mr. Nouman Anwer Butt raised the issue that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, it was noted that the complaint was filed by the Company Secretary namely Mr. Muhammad Haneef Idrees, which was not only bearing the signatures but also beard the seal of the respondent's undertaking. A certified true copy of Board Resolution No. 12/2011 by circulation passed on 17th August, 2011 was also annexed with the complaint. In the said Board Resolution along with Company Secretary, Mr. Sarfaraz Sadiqui, Chief Executive Officer of the company was also authorized on behalf of company in the matter to take all necessary measures, required in this regard before the Competition Commission of Pakistan and all courts, arbitrators, Tribunal, Forum or Administrative Authority in relation to the said matter. 
Before examining the remaining issues including contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act, we would like to deal with certain objections raised by the respondents. The trademark authority and the copyright authority under the relevant legislation have the power upon the case where ""DHL World Wide Express"" registered its trademark and copy right, therefore, the impugned order in the given circumstances is without jurisdiction. The aforesaid issue has been examined and it has been observed that involvement of a person in violation of provisions of the Competition Act provides necessary jurisdiction to the Commission to take cognizance in such type of situation for necessary orders. In these circumstances, the objection raised by Raja Asir Munir is totally uncalled for and unjustified.
Now coming to the issue that whether the appellants have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general or in particular, learned counsel for IDHS and DHIL have been asked to explain the logical reasoning and justification for adoption of marks IDHS and DHIL, however both of them could not give any justification which could be considered convincing to have mark almost identical to DHL. On the other hand a company was incorporated by three friends, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn having DHL as an essential part of company name and also used as a trademark. It is, therefore, observed that mark having resemblance with DHL is intentionally selected to confuse the market. Again the aforesaid logo has a lot of similarity with DHL.
As regards the contravention of the provision of the section 10 of the Act in general or particular, one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trademark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. To analyze the provision of section 10 more conveniently the said section 10(2)(d) is reproduced as below:-
""fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name and product labeling or packaging""
Coming to the third issue that whether the order of the Competition Commission of Pakistan is bad in the eyes of law being against the fact and passed arbitrarily. The appellants have failed to explain as to why and how the order passed by the Competition Commission could be illegal and how it is against the law and facts of the case and passed arbitrarily. Such statements without any cogent arguments and corroborative case law remain inconsequential to the appeals. Further the contention of the appellants that the Competition Commission has passed the order without having jurisdiction to do so is incorrect. It is observed that since the appellants have been involved in violation of the provisions of Competition Act, 2010, therefore, the Commission has the necessary jurisdiction and the case has been validly and competently filed and decided by the Commission.

Versus
Messrs HAROON SWEET FACTORY and another---Respondents

","R.F.A. No. 108 of 2006, decided on 16th October, 2017.","13th July, 2017.","MUHAMMAD FARRUKH IRFAN KHAN, J.","The brief facts out of which this appeal has arisen are that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants/respondents from infringement of its Trade Mark Hilal Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant has been manufacturing and marketing sweets and candies bearing the said trade mark along with its label/wrapper in a particular colour scheme and design since 1988. It was also asserted that due to good quality, the sweets and candies of the appellant under this specific trade mark and label/wrapper have acquired great reputation and goodwill throughout the country. It was claimed that the said trademark along with its colour scheme and design was pending registration in class 30 under application No.1471128 and the copyrights in the said packaging of Hilal Khopra Candy Sweets is duly protected under the Trade Mark and Copy Rights Laws. Along with the suit the appellant attached certificate, regarding pendency of trademark registration application in class 30. The appellant alleged that by adopting a trademark Haroon Khopra Candy Sweets with identical packaging/label/wrapper, the respondents are not only infringing the appellant's trademark rights but also passing off their goods as the goods of the appellant and are thus continuously deceiving the appellant's customers besides causing financial loss to it.
The respondents defended the suit by filing their written statement and raised a preliminary objection that the suit was filed by an incompetent person. On merit it was pleaded that the appellant has merely filed a copy of the application for registration of the trademark which does not confer any exclusive right or cause of action in favour of the appellant; that it was at the most a suit for passing off which was to be filed before the Court of competent jurisdiction i.e. Civil Court and that the Court of District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the instant suit and adjudicate upon it. They refuted the plea of the appellant that Haroon Khopra Candy or its wrapper/label are similar or identical to Hilal Khopra Candy and its wrapper/label and submitted that as no exclusive right is vested in the appellant it cannot seek restraint against use of a label/wrapper having different colour scheme and design by the respondents under their trademark Haroon Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant had no cause of action. under heightened security.","1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for permanent injunction, against the defendants as prayed for? OPP
2. Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action to file the suit? OPD
3. Whether the suit for plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed in view of preliminary objection No.2? OPD
4. Whether the defendant is entitled to recover special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C. from the plaintiff? OPD
5. Relief.
","I hold that the colour scheme, design and getup of label/wrapper of respondent/defendant Ex-P-22 is deceptively and confusingly similar or nearly resemble the colour scheme, design and getup of the label/wrapper of Appellant/Plaintiff Ex-P-16 and is likely to cause confusion and deception to an unwary purchaser. Issue No. 2 is therefore, answered in favour of Appellant/Plaintiff and against the respondent/defendant. 
In view of my findings on issue No.1, it is held that appellant plaintiff has got a locus standi and a valid cause of action to file the suit. The findings of the learned Trial Court on this issue are over turned and it is decided in favour of the appellant/plaintiff against the respondent defendant.
These issues have already been decided in favour of the appellants. The findings of the learned Trial Court on these two issues are affirmed.
In view of my above findings the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2005 is set aside and suit of the appellant/plaintiff is decreed as prayed for with no order as to cost.
","From bare perusal of the wrappers/labels of both the parties it is to be noted that appellant's product packing Ex.P-16 comprises of dark blue label in which the dark blue shade becomes lighter going right side. The word Hilal is written in yellow on the left upper corner WHILE the label/wrapper of the respondent also has a dark blue, light blue, white, green and red colour scheme design and get up with only a few points of difference here and there as compared to that of the appellant's label/wrapper described above. 
PW-1 on behalf of the appellant deposed that defendants are marketing/selling 'Haroon Khopra Candy' sweets in a wrapper which is almost similar to that of the plaintiff's and as such they are deceiving the ordinary customers. On the other hand the respondent's witness DW-1 has deposed that the plaintiff has filed a false case against the defendant. He further stated that plaintiff's product is being sold by the name and style of 'Hilal Khopra Candy' whereas the name of defendant's product is 'Haroon Khopra Candy'; that the trademark of defendant's company is in the name of 'Haroon' while the name of plaintiff's trademark is 'Hilal'; that the defendant company is not copying the plaintiff's trademark. it can be concluded that these trademarks are identical. Moreover, it has come in the evidence of the defendant that Khopra is being sold by 30/35 companies in blue colour, as such it is concluded that even if plaintiff is prior user, even then it would not give right to the plaintiff to claim exclusive right in respect of' words Khopra Candy, hence it is concluded that the plaintiff was unable to prove issue.
The above findings of the learned Trial Court proceed on wrong premises. The Registration Certificate dated 20th November, 2014 of the plaintiff Ex.P-26 has not been taken into consideration in its true perspective. Only the disclaimer appearing on the Registration Certificate that appellant/plaintiff has no exclusive right in respect of Khopra Candy has been relied. Thus the Trial Court has erred in mixing the disclaimer on the word Khopra Candy with the rights that the appellant/plaintiff has claimed by virtue of the Registration of the features of the whole label i.e. colour scheme, design, get-up etc. In addition to this, the learned Trial Court has committed a further error by overlooking the established principle of law that for maintaining a passing off action registration of a trademark is not a requirement and even though there may be a disclaimer on any particular feature on a wrapper/label.
It has to be noted that under the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 a Mark has been defined by section 2(xxiv) as follows:-
""Mark includes, in particular a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name including personal name, signature, word, letter, numeral, figurative element, colour, sound or any combination thereof.""
Thus the law envisages each one of the above features namely, inter alia, a name, a word, figurative element, colour, etc., to be a mark by itself and goes on to further specify that any combination of these features would be a mark also. In the market place, generally for consumer products, it is usual for companies to market their products in attractive colourful labels/wrappers/packaging, which often carries a word, a figurative element, a particular colour scheme, design and get up. Each one of these features, as the definition of the 'Mark"" envisages, is a mark in itself. When one feature of a label consisting of a combination of marks is adopted or copied, infringement or copying of that feature (a mark) takes place which is liable to be remedied and it will not be a valid defence by a defendant that he has not adopted/imitated other features of the label mark, which may be different. Thus when a label comprising of a colour scheme, design and get up is copied/imitated by adopting a similar colour scheme, design and get up but with a different word, infringement to the extent of colour scheme design, and get up would take place and can be injuncted to that extent. Similarly if a word is copied but not the colour scheme, design and get up, the infringement takes place only to the extent of word mark and it will not be open to a defendant to allege that due to different word mark, or different colour scheme, design, get up, in the respective labels/packaging, there will be no likelihood of confusion or deception. This aspect has been explained/expounded in a number of reported cases, in a different context, by holding that when one or more of the essential features of a mark or a label is infringed, infringement takes place, for example, in the cases of ""Cecil De Cordova and others v. Vick Chemical Company"" (PLD 1951 Privy Council 108), Jamia Industries Ltd v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8), ""Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others"" (2001 SCMR 967) I would, therefore, hold that the plea that respondent's/defendant's mark is ""HAROON KHOPRA CANDY"" whereas Appellant's/Plaintiff's mark is ""HILAL KHOPRA CANDY"" and that the former's label/wrapper, colour scheme, design and get up, (Ex.P-22) which otherwise is confusing and nearly resembling to that of latter's label/wrapper colour Scheme, design and get-up (Ex.P-16) be considered to be different is not a legally sustainable defence and must be rejected.
Comparison by court between two marks not to be meticulous - Court to reach mind of an unwary purchaser - Question in cases of alleged conflict between two marks always being whether a person will be deceived when he sees one trade mark in absence of another mark.

","F.A. O. No. 17802 of 2019, decided on 28th March, 2019.","28th March, 2019","Amin-ud-Din Khan, J.","Through this appeal filed under Order XLII, Rule 1(r) of the C.P.C. the appellant; who is plaintiff, has challenged the order dated 16.01.2019 passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore, whereby an application for grant of temporary injunction, under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. was dismissed.
2. Yesterday, when the case was fixed for preliminary hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant was not available. The learned counsel for the respondents appeared with the permission of the Court at preliminary hearing stage, filed power of attorney and raised two objections that the appeal is barred by time and that the notice sent to the respondents in compliance with the Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. does not contain the copy of grounds of appeal, therefore, notice was defective one.
3. Mr. Ali Mohsin Qazalbash Advocate appeared along with Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat Advocate and stated that he is signatory of the notice sent to the respondents under Order XLIII, Rule 3 of the C.P.C. and the said notice mentioning the memo of appeal is attached and he confirms that memo of appeal was attached with the notice.
4. So far as the objection of learned counsel for the respondents with regard to the limitation is concerned; she stated that as order is dated 16.01.2019 and the respondents applied for issuance of certified copy, which were provided within a week, therefore, she has the impression that the appeal is barred by time when it was filed in this court on 26.03.2019.
5. The record was checked in the presence of learned counsel for the parties. As per certified copy of the impugned order attached with this appeal, the appellant moved an application for issuance of certified copy of the impugned order on 17.01.2019, which was prepared and delivered on 27.02.2019 and the appeal was filed on 26.03.2019. Therefore, it is within the prescribed period of limitation. Learned counsel for the respondents states that in this eventuality she will not press the point of limitation and further when the statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the grounds of appeal were attached with the notice, she will also not press the other objection.
 under heightened security.","It will be appropriate that the prayer of suit as well as prayer of the application moved under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. be reproduced. The prayer of the suit is as fellows:-
""It is respectfully prayed that this honourable Court may be pleased to pass a decree against the Defendants and and/or their chief executives, directors, secretaries, principal officer's, managers, shareholders, employees, servants, distributors, men, agents, stockists, retailers or dealers (hereinafter jointly referred to as the Defendants) in the following terms:-
a) pass a decree for declaration that the Plaintiff is the Proprietor and prior user in its own right of the trademark SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, used for retail stores on account of prior adoption and actual prior use of SAMSONITE for retail stores in class 35 for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., in Pakistan since year 2005 and AMERICAN TOURISTER thereafter for past 10 years, and that the Plaintiff is entitled under law to conduct its business of running retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., using SAMSONITE, and AMERICAN TOURISTER;
b) pass a decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants perpetually from using and advertising in any manner and in any media, SAMSONITE, alone or as house of Samsonite and AMERICAN TOURISTER for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., stores within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls, either themselves in Pakistan or through a franchise or distributor or licensee, agent in relation to luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc, of all types and related products or any limitation of Plaintiff's proprietary trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan, such as house of Samsonite and from committing acts of Unfair Competition in terms of section 67 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 and from passing off Defendants retail stores, services and business by using SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER as and for that of the Plaintiff.
c) pass a decree permanently restraining the Defendants from operating any Shops/Stores Outlets under the name and style of SAMSONITE or house of Samsonite and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan;
d) a further decree of permanent injunction restraining the Defendants from causing any damage or injury to the reputation and goodwill enjoyed by the Plaintiff in its trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER for retail stores in any manner whatsoever;
e) a further decree of permanent injunction restraining the Defendants from communicating to public through any electronic, social, print, audio or visual media any notices, remarks or statements regarding use of trademark, SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER by the Plaintiff for retail stores in Pakistan;
f) a further money decree against the Defendants for payment of Rs.500,000,000/- (Rupees five hundred million only) to Plaintiffs as damages on account of partial compensation for the loss and damage to the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiffs;
h) costs of the suit may also be awarded; and
i) grant any other relief that this honourable Court may deem appropriate.""
The prayer made in the application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. is as follows:
""It is therefore, respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the titled suit, this honourable Court may be pleased to issue a temporary injunction restraining the Defendants from using in any manner trademark SAMSONITE alone or as House of Samsonite, and AMERICAN TOURISTER, for retail stores for luggage, bags, suit cases, accessories etc., or for store within stores or retail display sections within stores, shopping malls and restrained from advertising trademarks SAMSONITE and AMERICAN TOURISTER in Pakistan in any manner in any media for retail stores.
The Plaintiff also prays for an ad-interim injunction till the disposal of this application.""
","I have noticed that there is an order passed by the court of competent jurisdiction i.e. High Court of Sindh at Karachi, the operative part of the order dated 24.07.2018 is as under:-
""I have come to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have already made out a prima facie case of infringement under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, as the defendant even after submitting an undertaking before the Court is still using the identical signage in the name of ""Samsonite"" for which there is not consent of the owner/proprietor of the trademark/trade name, in relation to goods and services falling within Class 18 and 35 of the Fourth Schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004, read with Rules, 11, 71 and 88 thereof, the injunction application bearing C.M.A. No. 12935/2017 is granted and the defendant and its officers, servants and agents are restrained from infringing the Samsonite Mark and or other marks of the plaintiffs and while allowing injunction application, I direct the Defendant to immediately remove the signage being used by them in their outlets within 30 days from the date of this order and shall file a proper affidavit to that effect in the office duly executed by any of the Directors and or owners of the Defendant company.
The appellant can contest and press all its right's before the said Court and while deciding the instant application learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property Tribunal, Lahore has passed the order in accordance with law. When the plaintiff/appellant failed to make out a case for grant of temporary injunction while showing the necessary ingredients i.e. prima facie arguable case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss in its favour, this Court has no reason to disagree with the findings recorded by the learned Presiding Officer, Intellectual Property, Lahore in the light of case law referred to by the learned counsel for the respondents. Consequently, this appeal having no substance stands dismissed in limine.","In the Court it was admitted that the brand of Samsonite is of the respondents and appellant is the sole distributor and the appellant set up independent Samsonite Stores, therefore, the suit was filed that the exclusive store is the idea of the plaintiff/appellant. States that for a long time they after set up the independent Samsonite Stores have a right that the injunctive order be granted on the basis of acquiescence on the part of respondents. Argues that the learned trial court fell in error while refusing the grant of temporary injunction on the ground that the damages have been claimed by the appellant, therefore, no case of grant of temporary injunction.
10. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents argues that no agreement in writing or distributorship has been provided. That the appellant was seller of the products of the respondents. That under Clause 18 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the respondents are registered and under Clause 35 of the Trade Mark Classification of Goods and Services the proceedings are pending, which are being resisted by the appellant. That under sections 86(c) and 76 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 protection of use is with the respondents and the respondents Nos.1 and 2 appointed the respondent No.3 as distributor in the year 2016, therefore, the suit was filed by the appellant in the Sindh High Court and a suit bearing No.2040 of 2017 was flied by the respondents before the High Court of Sindh at Karachi and the application for grant of temporary injunction was allowed vide order dated 24.07.2018. States that the suit for declaration was filed in the civil court by the present appellant at Lahore, the suit was dismissed and the appeal there against was also dismissed. A suit for damages was also filed by the appellant, which was dismissed for non-prosecution. Now it has been restored.",SA/F-18/L Appeal dismisse,Dismissed

ITALFARMACO S.P.A.---Petitioner
Versus
HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","C.O. No. 751 of 2010, decided on 17th May, 2017.",,,"An application under section 90(1)(b)(i) and section 80(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance"") has been filed by the applicant-company Italfarmaco S.P.A, a company existing under the laws of Italy through its authorized signatory (""the applicant""). The application has been filed for a declaration of invalidity of the entry in the Trademark Register of the trademark FERPLEX registered under No.130807 dated July 11, 1995 in class 5 for pharmaceutical preparations used as iron supplement. The trademark FERPLEX (""the trademark"") has been registered in the name of the respondent No.1 Himont Pharmaceuticals (""Himont"").
A license agreement dated 26.10.1994 was executed between the applicant and Himont regarding the manufacturing and sale of the trademark. The agreement is annexed with the application. The primary facts which form the foundation of the application are not in dispute between the parties and the parties are on common ground with regard thereto. Thus, the registration of the trademark in the name of Himont since the year 1996 was within the knowledge of the applicant and the position continued to subsist until the filing of the application for declaring the trademark as invalid. The license agreement between the parties was terminated by the applicant vide termination letter dated 27.4.2009.
It can be seen from a reading of the prayer clause of the suit filed by Himont that the suit seeks a declaration ""regarding the trademark FERPLEX"". The suit by Himont also seeks a declaration to the effect that exclusive agreement between the applicant and Himont is still valid and enforceable as also that Himont has the sole right to manufacture, market, supply, distribute and sale of the product FERPLEX in Pakistan. On 6.9.2010, the applicant also filed a suit before the District Court, Lahore under the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by the Ordinance. The suit by the applicant is for the grant of permanent injunction seeking to restrain Himont purportedly from infringing and using the trademark FERPLEX. Therefore, the suit by the applicant is also with regard to the trademark which is the subject matter of this application as well. It would be expedient to reproduce the prayer made in the suit by the applicant, which is as follow:-
""This honourable Court may further be pleased to pass/grant/direct:
a) An order directing the Defendant to recall all the stocks of its products from the market being sold under the imitated trademark FERPLEX as well as for destruction or replacement of the labels, plates, markings thereof along with destruction or handing over to the plaintiff for destruction of all the offending labels, plates, markings and other printed material bearing the imitated trademark FERPLEX.
b) To remove all figures, hoarding, boards, neon signs etc., bearing imitated trademark FERPLEX.
c) An order directing the Defendant to get all its Marketing Approval/Drug Registration for imitated trademark FERPLEX transferred to the name of the plaintiff.
d) Any other relief that this honourable Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the present case.""
Once again, it is evident from the prayer reproduced above that the injunction has been sought with regard to the trademark FERPLEX and ancillary reliefs have been asked for which inter alia include an order directing the defendant to have all its marketing approval/drug registration transferred to the name of the applicant. under heightened security.","It is correct that Himont was a licensee of the applicant under a license agreement executed on 26.10.1994. The agreement has effectively been terminated w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Himont alleges that the agreement could not be terminated and has brought a suit before the District Court, Lahore. The parties are at variance with regard to the fact whether the agreement gave the power to Himont to have the trademark registered in its name. The parties are poles apart on the interpretation put on the different clauses of the license agreement with regard to this aspect. The applicant asserts that by the license agreement, Himont was merely conferred a license for the use of trademark FERPLEX within the territory of Pakistan. The applicant provided requisite data and information to Himont to enable it to obtain marketing approval/drug registration under the trademark FERPLEX and based on the information and data provided by the applicant, Himont succeeded in obtaining market registration from the applicant for formulating, manufacturing and selling the FERPLEX products as licensee of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the trademark was registered with the Registrar of Trademark in the name of Himont and the current application has been made by the applicant to declare as invalid the registration of the trademark."," In view of the above, C.M No.1-C of 2011 is allowed. The application is hereby returned to the applicant to be filed before the appropriate forum.
","Two grounds form the nub of the applicant's arguments with regard to the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by Himont. These grounds revolve around the true construction of provisions of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. Firstly, the learned counsel states that in fact no proceedings are pending with the District Court within the contemplation of the term as used in subsection (4) and thus, the exception to subsection (4) is not attracted so as to convince this Court to allow the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. Secondly, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the purposive construction of subsection (4) was that the choice to approach the appellate forum was retained by the applicant who brings an application under section 80 for seeking a declaration of invalidity with regard to a trademark.
the application may be made by an interested party either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thus far, the choice lies with an interested party to file an application either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thereafter follows an exception which has been provided in subsection (4). In terms of that exception if the proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court the application shall be made to the High Court or a District Court. The learned counsel for the applicant laid great stress on the aspect that the proceedings before the District Court were not proceedings within the ambit of the term as used in clause 'a' of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. This submission of the learned counsel is nuanced and has no legal legs to stand upon. The term 'proceedings' is a compendious term and includes all or any causes which are brought before the courts and on which the courts can undertake judicial proceedings. It would suffice to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as the State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) for an elaboration to the term 'proceedings'. It was held that:-
""Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, interpretation of the word 'proceeding' as interpreted in various pronouncements given above, we are of the opinion that the word 'proceedings' is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" means the instituting or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a 'proceeding' is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or judicial officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an action.""
The learned counsel for the applicant attempted to make a subtle distinction on an issue which arises peripherally from the first submission made by the learned counsel with regard to the meaning of the term 'proceedings'. He stated that the proceedings before the District Court were not regarding the use of the trademark but merely sought the cancellation of the registration of the drug with the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan. n order to understand the proposition raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, the prayers made in the suits filed by the parties before the District Court, Lahore have been brought forth above. In this application, the prayer is to the effect that the trademark registration be declared as invalid in terms of section 90(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and in the alternate it has been prayed that registration of trademarks be rectified by substituting the name of the applicant as the proprietor of the registered trademark. Therefore, the entire prayer of the applicant constitutes a request for a declaration of invalidity with regard to the trademark registered in the name of Himont. If we were to juxtapose the prayers made in this application with the one made by Himont in its suit before District Court, Lahore it would become evident that Himont has prayed for the converse of what the applicant has prayed in the instant application. 
It is under these circumstances that inter alia a declaration has been sought in the suit for the continued use of the trademark FERPLEX by Himont as also for a declaration that any use of the trademark FERPLEX by any party including the defendant shall be an act of unfair competition and in violation of Himont's commercial and equitable rights. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any of its agents from obstructing the business of Himont has also been sought. More importantly, a decree for permanent injunction has been sought restraining the applicant herein either directly or indirectly from using the trademark FERPLEX in Pakistan in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the relief claimed in the suit filed by Himont is in conflict and directly contrary to what has been asked for in the present application. 
The learned counsel for the applicant made a reference to section 72 of the Trademark Act, 1940 and referred to the words ""as the case may be"" as used in section 72 of the Act, 1940. He also referred to section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 in which in subsection (4)(a) while making a similar exception the legislature has used the words ""as the case may be"". Precisely, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the absence of these words has left a choice with the applicant to make the application to either the High Court or the District Court. This argument by the learned counsel will virtually have the effect of nullifying the intention of the legislature in providing an exception and will make the entire exception as redundant. It is trite principle and a rule of construction that redundancy cannot be attached to any provisions enacted by the legislature. If the argument of the learned counsel were to be accepted, this will mean that the application may be filed with the High Court or a District Court irrespective of the proceedings pending in the High Court or a District Court. This will have the unholy effect of making a mockery of the law and, therefore, such an interpretation could not be countenanced.
The wrongness of the argument is also evident from a consideration of the provisions of section 73 of the Ordinance. Section 73, so far as relevant, reads as under:-
73(4) An application for revocation may be made by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-
a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in case the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Subsection (4) confers the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for revocation on the Registrar. Thus, and it requires to be reemphasized, the power vests in the Registrar and nor in either the High Court or the District Court. 
The exception is couched in broad terms. The words ""if proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or, the District Court "" evince a broad-based and wide-ranging concept which is inclusive. From the meaning of the term 'proceedings' brought out in the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, there is no doubt that it embraces within it the suits filed by the parties before the District Court and the current application too. But the key word in any opinion is 'concerning'. It connotes all or any proceedings even remotely touching upon the trademark in question. The word renders the entire concept fluid and plastic without being hedged in, in any manner. If the proceedings are brought under the provisions of the Ordinance, they are necessarily proceedings concerning trademark, whether they arise out of a contact or are brought for revocation of registration or for declaring as invalid the registration of a trademark. In this case, Himont resists the application for invalidity, tooth and nail. It seeks both the license agreement and the registration to be declared as valid in the suit before the District Court. The applicant says that retention of the registration of trademark is not a specific prayer in the suit filed by Himont. That may be so but the effect of declaring the license agreement to be subsisting and valid would have the consequence of impacting the question of registration too and there is no escape from it. The use of the word 'shall' too lends actuality to the analysis and clearly brings forth the mandatory nature of the provision.
As if this was not enough, the legislature enacted section 116 to reinforce the purpose of bringing in the exception in subsection (4) of section 80. Section 116 is to the following effect:-
""116. Procedure in certain cases of option to apply to the High Court, a District Court or the Registrar- Where under this Ordinance, an applicant has the option of making an application either to the High Court or a District Court or to the Registrar-
a) if any suit or proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending before the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in any other case, if the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Once again, section 116 conceptualises the same statutory enterprise and is an overarching provision which applies to all applications made under the Ordinance. It seeks to attain the same end, that is, all decisions concerning a trademark should be consistent and made by the same forum.
The learned counsel for the applicant relied upon Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Rafiuddin v. Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 2 others (1994 MLD 874) and Iqbal Begum v. Farooq Inayat and others (PLD 1993 Lahore 183). These judgments elaborate upon the concept and contours of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary to allude to these precedents as the concept is very well settled and the issue regarding the applicability or otherwise of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. does not arise as it is not denied that in these proceedings the general provisions of civil procedure apply and in case this Court comes to the conclusion that the present proceedings are caught by the mischief of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance, this Court has the power to make necessary directions in order to give effect to those provisions and there is no cavil with this proposition.
The learned counsel for Himont referred to Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833) which was a case concerning application under section 73 of the Ordinance for the revocation of the trademark. It was held in this judgment that the application ought to be filed with the Registrar and the only exception which allows the filing of such an application before the High Court if proceedings were already pending with the High Court. This precedent can be cited as a complete answer to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has a choice to file the proceedings either before the High Court or before the District Court. Messrs H & B, General Trading Company through Director v. Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028) is a Division Bench judgment of the Karachi High Court which held that proceedings under sections 73 and 80 of the Ordinance require such proceedings to be filed before the forum where proceedings concerning the trademark is already pending. This judgment is on all fours with the facts in the instant application and primarily supports the findings rendered in the instant application. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that all such proceedings must be decided by the same forum and this was based on sound principles of administration of justice and judicial governance and proceeded thereafter to return the application to be filed at the proper forum. The appeal before the Division Bench arose out of a judgment of the Single Bench of the Karachi High Court reported as 2009 CLC 354 which substantially arrived at the same conclusion which was affirmed by the Division Bench.",KMZ/I-18/L Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","File Nos.3 [REG/COMP/BMW/SEC.10/CCP/09 and 4/REG/COMP/H.D/SEC.10 /CCP/09, decided on 16th August, 2010.",,,"Messrs Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft and Messrs H-D Michigan L.L.C. (hereinafter referred to as 'BMW' and 'HD', respectively; and collectively referred to as the 'Complainants') filed complaints under Section 10 of the Ordinance read with Regulation 17 of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007 alleging that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using Complainants' registered trademarks on its products. It was further alleged that such use of Complainants' trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' and is prohibited in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance. The contents of the complaints are summarized as follows:
That BMW is a Company organized under and existing under the laws of Germany, having its registered office at Petuelring 130, BMW House, 80809 Munich, Germany. That BMW in the year 1917 developed the famous logo of BMW. The idea .of this logo was primarily based on the Circular Design of Aircraft propeller as well as the blue and white segments were reflective of the Bavarian coat of arms. 
That the goods sold and business conducted using trademark, service mark, company name and trade name BMW and BMW Logo throughout the world by BMW have been widely advertised in international magazines, periodicals and news papers which also have circulation in Pakistan and/or most have been seen by the Pakistani public and BMW has spent huge amount of money for this purpose which has resulted in the tremendous awareness of the trademark, trade name, service mark and company name of BMW and BMW Logo which are recognized by the traders and the general public throughout the world including Pakistan as originating and/or having association with BMW or under its authority.
That BMW has authorized Messrs Dewan Farooq Motors Limited, a Pakistani Company as authorized Importers/Dealers/Distributors for its BMW cars in Pakistan. .
That BMW, over a period of time, expanded its range of goods to other allied or related goods as well as large variety of fashion and luxury merchandise, accessories, etc., and in order to distinguish its goods, business and services from those of others, BMW either itself or through its subsidiaries, licensees and/or affiliates uses amongst other BMW as Trademark logo. Businesses and services include; cars, car accessories, automobile parts, motorcycles, bikes, mountain bikes, cruise bikes, kids bikes, bags and various other products such as golf kits, golf balls, golf sticks, wallets, key chains, fountain pens, ball points, umbrellas, locks, clothing, jackets, leather jackets, leather bags, jeans, caps, sport shirts, T-Shirts, cigarette cases and lighters etc.
That HD is an American motorcycle manufacturer. Founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the first decade of the 20th century, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great depression.
That HD also carries on, either itself or through its licensees, affiliates of associated companies, a wide range of manufacturing such as motorcycle, its parts and accessories and other wide range of products including but not limited to motorcycle clothing, motorcycle sports apparels including leather jackets, lifestyles accessories, which are marked using HD's trademarks.
There is no authorized dealer of HD in Pakistan and they have not authorized AGI to use their Trade Mark on its products.
 It has been alleged in the complaint that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using HD's registered trademarks on its products. It has been alleged that such use of HD's trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' in terms of Section 10 (2) (a), (b) & (c) of the Ordinance. HD has also appended the images from the website of AGI. (Annex-A and B to this Order).
 with new technological evidence.","Upon receipt of the complaint, the Commission asked the Complainants' through its counsel, vide its letter dated 9-10-2009 to attend a meeting at the offices of the Commission in Islamabad on 14-10-2009 and to provide the following supporting documents/information within ten days of receipt of the letter:--
 
(i) A copy of authorization to act on behalf of the Complainants',
 
(ii) Certified copies of the Trade Mark Registration Certificates',
 
(iii) Whether any proceedings regarding the captioned matter between the Complainants and AGI have already been decided by any court of law or the Trade Mark Registry or by any other statutory body? If yes, then to provide the Commission with all pleadings and Orders passed thereon;
 
(iv) Whether the Complainants every authorized AGI to manufacture the leather jackets in the past for the Complainants?
 
(v) Details relating to the legal status of AGI;
 
(vi) When and how did it come to the Complainants' knowledge that AGI was allegedly using their trade mark? ;
 
(vii) What other forms of advertisement is AGI using besides advertising the jackets online for sale? ;
 
(viii) Whether the Complainants are aware of any sales made by AGI regarding the products advertised, bearing their trade mark? And to provide any sales receipts or purchase orders, if any, of those sales;
 
(ix) Whether the Complainants are also manufacturing and selling similar products themselves?
","Hence, keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am of the considered view that, deceptive marketing in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance has been carried out by AGI and the fraudulent use of the trademark by AGI was very much capable of harming the business interest of the complainants in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) and (d) of the Ordinance.
Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Ordinance, however, the approach of the representative of AGI needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and even amended their website immediately after receipt of letter from the Commission. In addition to the fact that he admitted the violation of the Ordinance not only at the enquiry stage but also during the course of hearing and cooperated by submitting all the record requisitioned by the Commission and apologizing and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit. I am, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 2,50,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, AGI is reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Ordinance.
In terms of what has been stated above both the Show Cause Notices Nos. 18 and 19 of 2010 issued to AGI are hereby disposed.
 

","The Complainant's counsel vide its letter dated December 21, 2009, provided the Commission with the fax numbers of AGI and also requested that substituted mode of service may please be adopted for serving the complaints to AGI.
The Complaints were again sent through fax and through courier vide letter dated 22-12-2009. This time the Complaints were received by the Respondent both through fax and through courier.
 
AGI vide its letters dated 6-1-2010 filed identical reply to both the Complaints, which reads as follows:
""That the Respondent is neither any incorporated concern nor a registered firm rather a small businessman under sole proprietorship. On initiation of business desirous to have some website and after having got prepared the same it was placed on web.
 
That the Respondent having no knowledge about such type of special laws innocently offered the garments from trade, with no intention to deceive any person in the universe in any manner whatsoever. However, if this hurt the Complainants, I am Sorry for the act and ready to amend the same and change the website accordingly rather has asked for it.""

The enquiry officers after analyzing and examining the Complaints and the above correspondence concluded the enquiry by producing the Enquiry Report dated 17-5-2010 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Enquiry Report""). The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""Though the conduct and attitude of the Respondent may appear to be innocent and ignorant of special laws such as the Ordinance, however, we are inclined with the legal principle that ignorance of law can be of no excuse. Therefore, in view of the above facts, annexures appended herewith, images of the website of the Respondent, and clear admission of the Respondent that, prima facie, there is a violation of Section 10(1) of the Ordinance and in particular clauses (a), (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance, on part of the Respondent.""
At the hearing on 17-6-2010, Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan submitted his analysis of the data provided by AGI and emphasized that the documents did not conform with the statements made at the previous hearing by the representatives of AGI. According to Mr. Khan AGI had a higher turnover than stated by Mr. Tayyab Ali at the first hearing. Mr. Tayyab Ali in response once again apologized and said that he has not lied to the Commission and has correctly stated the facts. He further added that in Sialkot several undertakings are engaged in such practices and they need to be educated through their chamber of commerce that they are in violation of the Ordinance. He filed the undertaking before the Commission admitting the violation of the Ordinance and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit.
Having gone through all the documents available on the record. The main issue which emerges in the matter is whether AGI has engaged itself into the deceptive marketing practices in violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance?
Since, AGI's admission, firstly at the enquiry stage vide its letter dated 6-1-2010 and subsequently vide its undertaking before me on 17-6-2010, leaves no doubt that they were using the trademarks of the Complainants on the images available on their website. During the hearing it was also admitted by AGI that, although they do not have the resources but advertising embellished details such as the capital, staff, tenure of the business always adds to the strength and popularity of the company amongst prospective customers and helps in fetching more orders from abroad. This admission in itself speaks volumes that, the proprietor of AGI although claims to be innocent and ignorant of law, is not that innocent at all. Further the allegations by the Complainant that their logos were used on the website by AGI knowingly that they are famous renowned logos owned by other companies, was never refuted by AGI and although not expressly admitted by the AGI but the statements made by them implies that the trademarks of Complainants' were used owing to their popularity amongst the public at large. The only justification which was afforded by the representatives of AGI was 'ignorance of law'.
During the course of hearing, I was informed by the representatives of AGI that as soon as AGI received letter from the Commission at the enquiry stage they removed all the images containing the registered logos of the complainant and have also amended their website. However, the counsel for the Complainant opposed this and submitted that on the following link the AGI's page showing the image of BMW jacket is still available.
I am least impressed with the justification afforded by AGI for violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance that, they were not aware that 'they were in breach and/or in contravention of any law'. It is pertinent to point out that 'ignorance of law is no excuse' is primarily based on the legal maxims Ignorantia juris non excusat which means ignorance of the law does not excuse or Ignorantia legis neminem excusat which means ignorance of the law excuses no one. The rationale behind these maxims is that if ignorance was an excuse, a person charged with criminal offence or a subject of a civil law suit would merely claim that he/she or it was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even though the person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law imputes knowledge of all laws to all persons within the jurisdiction no matter how transiently, especially to the laws which relates to the business which the person is involved in.
Furthermore, in the matter of Ahmad Bakhsh and 3 others v. Managing Director, (Superintending Engineer) WAPDA Electric Supply Company, Multan, 1995 PLC 536, it was held as follows:
""Nobody, could plead ignorance of provisions of Constitution or any other codified law, because after such law was notified in official Gazette; presumption would be that everybody living in country would have knowledge thereof'
Keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am inclined to hold that, plea of ignorance cannot be accepted as a valid justification or defence, at all. Moreover, the representative of AGI himself admitted that the information provided on the website regarding the establishment of AGI, its staff, its capital and ancillary details are only provided to build a good image and to fetch more orders from abroad, hence any plea of innocence does not seem tenable. In view of this clear intent and objective, it only makes the use of the subject trademarks as fraudulent on part of AGI.
With reference to the allegation that the unauthorized/fraudulent use of Complainant's registered trade marks by AGI is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant in terms of clause (a) subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance read with subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Ordinance.
The Complainants' counsel has submitted documents and copies of the certificate making it clear that the trademarks used by AGI on its website are exclusively owned by the Complainant and the documents available on the record also establish that the logos are well recognized and holds goodwill to themselves and are not only well known in the public at large but are also well recognized.
The documents and evidence available on the record such as the website images and the catalogues submitted by the Complainants establish that they are involved in the manufacturing and sale of the products, which AGI advertised on its website. There is no doubt that, the website of AGI is accessible from any where around the world and the products advertised and offered for sale on AGI's website are same as the ones manufactured and marketed by the Complainants, as well. In presence of the website images of AGI and their admission regarding unauthorized use of trade marks of the Complainant, there is no doubt in reaching to the conclusion that the information disseminated by AGI through its website is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainants with reference to the products advertised therein.

3. Respondent No.1 (Messrs Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.) Limited) a company incorporated in Pakistan under the Companies Ordinance 1984, Manufacturers, Merchants, Importers and Exporters, opposed the registration of Trade Mark ""AHMED TEA"" advertised under application No.149770 Class-30 in the Trade Marks Journal No.632, on the grounds that they have for many years carried on a reputable business in Pakistan and outside the country as manufacturers, merchants, importer and exporters of wide range of products falling in Class-29, 30 and 32; that they are well known all over the country and in every part of the world due to huge exports of food items and other allied goods; having overseas offices, manufacturing companies in a number of countries and have local agents and distributors; that the trademark use by them in respect of its aforesaid business is AHMED which besides being its principal world famous trademark is also its house mark; that word Ahmed also forms a part of their corporate name Ahmed Food Industries (Pvt.)

The registration of person in the register of proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation of those goods and that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person, who not being the proprietor of the trade mark of a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembles it as to likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered.

The respondent No.1 is authorized user of the mark 'AHMED'; the respondent No.1. has been using the mark 'AHMED' since 1952; the respondent No.1's mark 'AHMED' is registered in both classes i.e '29 and 30' of fourth schedule; dealing with goods of such classes both nationally and internationally.
The appellant has applied for registration of 'AHMED' as it 'mark'; the registration of such 'mark' is for class '30'; A bare look at mark of appellant cannot be said to be dissimilar to that of trade mark of the respondent No.1 i.e 'AHMED' for reading and even is phonetically identical.
since the 'tea' will be sold from one and same counter wherefrom goods of the respondent No.1 shall be sold because it has no where, been claimed by the appellant that respondent No.1 sells its goods at its own 'outlet'. Further, it is also not the case of the appellant that the goods of appellant i.e 'tea' shall be offered/sold to some other class of public therefore, prima facie, the Registrar was quite right in refusing the registration of the mark of the appellant in 'class-30'.

DALDA FOODS (PRIVATE) LIMITED---Appellant

M/S SHIELD CORPORATION LIMITED---Respondent
 

 
","High Court Appeal No. 244 of 2014, decided on 18th March, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Being aggrieved by the order dated 16 September, 2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.752 of 2014, disposing of the injunction application in favour of the present Respondent and restraining the Appellant from using the trade mark ""Shield and Device of Shield"", holding it identical and deceptively similar with the trade mark ""Health Shield plus Device of Shield"" of the Plaintiff, the instant appeal has been filed.
While the learned Single Judge has dealt the matter at length in the impugned order, snapshot of the controversy is that the Respondent who is a leading national entity engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling goods related to toothpaste, toothbrushes and baby care products since 1974 and, as claimed by his counsel and as per the copies of numerous trade mark registration certificates attached along with his counter, has obtained registration of the said trade mark, which acts as a house mark, in respect of all goods/services falling in Class-1 to Class 45 of the International Classification of Goods and Services under the Nice agreement (applicable in Pakistan also), notwithstanding that the business of the Respondent doesn't fall in more than a few classes of goods, in particular, class 3 for toothpaste, class 21 for toothbrushes, and class 10 for baby feeders and alike baby products.
On the other hand, the Appellant is a manufacturer and one of the most renowned vegetable ghee and cooking oil brand in the country taking the inception from pre-partition days and enjoys immense household reputation in relation to their goods i.e. Banaspati Ghee and Vegetable Oils, falling in Class 29. with a different defendant.","To us, beside what has been settled in the above paragraph, the present controversy revolves around two basic elements:
(i) A trader while in the business of selected range of goods registers his trade mark in respect of all or a large number of classes of goods/services and uses the said instrument of registration certificate to restrain other traders from using a portion of his trade mark in respect of goods which the former has never manufactured and seeks to restrain the latter from using the portion of his trade mark in relation to goods which are of prime commercial interest to the latter; and
(ii) In what circumstances a trade mark can be held to be confusedly similar with another trade mark?
The answer to the second point is buried in piles of cases dating back centuries where courts have established the test of comparing two trade marks. These tests have been over and over used in numerous cases including those decided by courts in Pakistan. Briefly speaking the courts have come to the conclusion that while comparing as to deceptive similarity of two trade mark, the test known as Classic Trinity requires courts to consider following three aspects:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.","Thus, in the instant case, on account of the foregoing considerations, we come to the conclusion that the allegations of the Respondent are completely flawed on all the above discussed accounts, and the Appellant has legit reasons to continue to use its impugned trade mark. These are the reasons for the short order passed on 24.02.2016 allowing this appeal and dismissing the injunction application filed in the Suit No. 752/2014.","In order to give a face to the controversy, we find it prudent to reproduce the two contesting trade marks in the following:
Appellant's Trade Mark Respondent's Trade Mark
Also of relevance, is the manner in which these trade marks are used on their respective products; which we reproduce as under:
Appellant's Product Sample Respondent's Product Sample
There is a difference between the use of a mark (or sign) ordinarily and use of a mark as a trade mark. While a mark could be any graphical representation of a visually perceivable item on the packaging of a product (in the instant case), and the consumer connects it with the source of the goods. In other words when a mark (or sign) is used as a trade mark, it starts connecting products (or services) to their respective sources and origins and the customer uses the said mark when choosing a particular product, or when refusing another product instead. The manufacturer of Dalda cooking oil decides to remove the said Health Shield sign from its packaging, it will not affect distinctiveness of trade mark Dalda and the customer will always reach out and choose Dalda as their choice of product, in this example. This is the key difference between a mark (or sign) and a trade mark.
In the instant case, it is admitted that the Respondent has reputation and goodwill in its trade mark, however, such reputation and goodwill is only limited to the goods falling in Classes 3, 21 and 10, being toothbrushes, toothpastes, baby feeders and allied baby products. With regards, part 2, ""misrepresentation"" made by the Appellant, it can also be seen by looking at the complete packaging of the Appellant's product (as reproduced in paragraph 5), that no attempt has been made by the Appellant to misrepresent or disguise itself as the Respondent or to sail close to the Respondent. Applying the ""Moron In A Hurry"" test in the instant case, we tend to agree that even a moron in a hurry will not pick a bottle of Dalda cooking oil instead of Shield toothpaste, even if his last train is leaving for home in the next 5 minutes, on a Friday night.
With regards the third part of classic trinity, there is no iota in our mind that when products of both the parties are so different in nature, sold to different customer-needs, kept at different locations in shops (usually); a case of actual damage or loss to the Respondent on account of Appellant's use of the impugned trade mark could be imagined even. Therefore without taking any further time, we can safely conclude that the classic trinity test passes in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondent.
a trade mark is a badge of origin, the grant of a registration certificate is made to the person who uses (or honestly proposes to use) a trade mark in the course of trade to the benefit of customers so that the customers can distinguish the said trader's goods apart from other competitors' products. A trade mark registration certificate is thus a seal imposed by the Government certifying that goods manufactured (or sold) under the said trade mark will only and legitimately be sourced by the person in whose name the trade mark is registered. The concept of purity of trade mark register hinges to the idea that trade marks which are not used by their respective owners, shall be removed from the register of trade marks since possession of the registration certificate without active commercial use of the trade mark negates the very purpose of trade mark legislation.
By stretching beyond the umbrella provided, the legislation intends to mean that the person who has registered a trade mark is threatening infringement thereof when the defendant is (a) not using the identical trade mark; or (b) not in the course of trade; and (c) not using the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services. It could be thus seen that the act of the Appellant does not come anywhere inside the triangle created by these three pillars, therefore no infringement of the registered trade mark of the Respondent has been established.
As a last round, the counsel for the Respondent contended the act of the Appellant is causing ""dilution"" of the Respondent's trade mark. While, at the first hand, since the mark of the Respondent is allegedly registered in class 29, therefore a better claim (as already raised by it) ought to be of infringement, rather than of dilution. While there is no global list of well-known trade marks, but Coca-Cola; Google; Apple; McDonalds; Microsoft; IBM; Citibank; Boeing; Toyota are said to qualify such a list. With regards national trade marks, without prejudice, we are of the opinion, and such list could include trade marks like Mobilink, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, which on the basis of their immense reputation and goodwill, could be protected from unauthorized use on non-competing goods and services. Therefore to allege the 'dilution' claim, the Respondent has to prove the highest degree of fame required under section 86, to which in our opinion, trade mark of the Respondent SHIELD does not rise.

","Suit No. 471 of 2022, decided on 19th July, 2022.","5th 14th and 25th April, 2022.","MUHAMMAD FAISAL KAMAL ALAM, J.","Relevant facts for deciding this Injunction Application is that Plaintiffs are exporters of Rice to over forty countries worldwide, including Federal Republic of Somalia. Plaintiffs own and operate a state of the art equipment and rice milling equipment: besides, Plaintiff No.1 possesses highest capacity for parboiling Basmati Rice, whereas, Plaintiff No.2 also has presence in Dubai. United Arab Emirates (""UAE""): Plaintiff No.3 has received the Presidential Award for highest export of Pakistani Basmati Rice to various countries around the globe.
Averred that up till 07.03.2022. Plaintiffs have been exporting 'PK-386 Long Grain Rice' with the package livery stating 'HAMZA' (in a green ellipse. coupled with paddy leaves). Collectively Plaintiffs have a considerable market share in the Somalian market.
on 07.03.2022 a Public Notice was published, whereby, Defendant No.1 caused for the threatening of legal consequences against exporters of rice, whose package livery shall bear the 'Hamza' in a green ellipse, coupled with paddy leaves; this Public Notice published in the daily 'Nawa-e-Waqt' is appended as Annexure 'F' of the plaint, at page-2263. with a different defendant.","Legal team of Plaintiffs argued that upon investigation, it was found that the Subject Mark bearing No.500595 in Class-30 was registered on 07.12.2021, besides, Defendant No.1 also fraudulently obtained registration under the category of 'Artistic Work' bearing Registration No.44834-COPR on 04.02.2022, given by the Defendant No.3 (Copyright Office Karachi - Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan). Sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law have been referred to fortify the arguments that the impugned registration granted by official Defendants Nos.2 and 3 is in violation of these provisions and results in unfair competition, as Defendant No.1 has ousted the Plaintiffs from the export of subject rice to other countries, particularly, Somalia. The afore referred public notice was in fact a threat of infringement proceeding, against which the present Lis is filed and the record appended with the plaint, inter alia, relating to the exports of Plaintiff shows that both the Official Defendants Nos.2 and 3 have wrongly registered the mark so also the logo","In view of the above discussion, I am afraid, basic ingredients for grant of an injunctive relief are not present in the case of Plaintiffs, as admittedly, it is the Defendant No. 1, which is the holder of a Registered Trade Mark and not Plaintiffs. Consequently, injunction application [C.M.A. No.5259 of 2022] is dismissed.
12. Defendant No.1 is further directed to maintain proper accounts of its business activities and, particularly, relating to exports, from the date of registration of the Impugned Trademark till the pendency of present Lis and the same should be furnished/filed monthly, under the Statement of learned Advocate for Defendant No.1. In this regard the Office will make a separate File for keeping the record of above Accounts.","The contention of Plaintiffs, that 'HAMZA' is a common trademark used by different entities, including Plaintiffs, hence, it should not have been registered is considered in the light of case law cited by both learned Advocates for Plaintiffs and private Defendant No.1. None of the cited decisions has determined this crucial point that if a person or an entity has a registered trademark in its favour, even then he or the said entity would not be entitled for its exclusive use, on the basis of 'publici juris'. The case law relied upon by Plaintiffs' legal team, in particular, the reported Decisions handed down in Master case and Haico case (supra) though have discussed the concept of 'publici juris', but the injunction was not granted, primarily, considering the fact that in both cases the mark was not registered in favour of plaintiffs (of the reported cases). Adverting to the second contention of Plaintiffs, about applicability of sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law. In this regard judgment handed down by learned Division Bench of this Court in Dalda Foods (ibid) is perused, wherein, inter alia, sections 52 and 67 of the TM Law are also discussed. Shield Corporation Limited/respondent (of the reported case) has obtained an injunctive order in the suit filed by it, against the appellant-Dalda Foods, restraining the latter from using the trademark 'Shield and Device of Shield'. Learned Division Bench has allowed the Appeal and set aside the injunction order, mainly, on the basis that use of the word 'health shield' by appellant - Dalda Foods on its product is neither a misrepresentation nor a deceptive tactic for confusing some unwary buyer. Conversely, situation here is opposite; admittedly, the trademark of Defendant No.1 has been registered, against which, as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, revocation proceeding has been initiated, which is sub judice.
Secondly, as per the official version, present Plaintiffs did not contest the proceeding before the Registrar when the trademark in question was in the process of registration.
Thirdly, the Certificate of Registration (impugned), appended with the Counter Affidavit of Defendant No.l dated 17.12.2021, bears a disclaimer, that registration of this trade mark shall give no right to the exclusive use of word ""HAMZA"" except substantially as shown on the label.
Fourthly, with the Counter Affidavit of Defendant No. 1, it has also attached the Copyright registration dated 4-2-2022, in the artistic work (Label Design) entitled ""HAMZA"".

This challenge is based on the grounds that the Plaintiff has not disclosed any valid cause of action against the Defendant, that factual and legal inaccuracies exist in the Plaintiff’s case, and that pertinent information was withheld to sway the Tribunal. The Defendant asserts prior use of the trademark since 2007-2008 and an attempted registration in 2009, which was abandoned due to lack of legal expertise. under heightened security.","The main issue revolves around whether the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 should be vacated. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff lacks a prima facie case, the balance of convenience does not favor the Plaintiff, and there is no likelihood of irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. The Defendant also asserts prior use and registration attempts for the trademark.","The Tribunal finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated a case for the continuance of the interim injunction. It highlights that owning a well-known mark does not absolve the Plaintiff from proving all necessary elements for injunctive relief. Consequently, the Ad Interim Injunction dated 03.05.2018 is vacated, and the suit is ordered to proceed without the injunction in place.","The Tribunal’s reasoning includes an evaluation of whether all three essential criteria for granting an injunction—prima facie case, balance of convenience, and likelihood of irreparable damage—are met. It reviews the legal standards for granting injunctions, particularly focusing on the principle of ""Dilution"" and whether the Plaintiff’s mark qualifies as a well-known mark under the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001.

","Suits Nos. 94 and 124 of 2020, decided on 7th April, 2020.","6th February, 2020.","ADNAN IQBAL CHAUDHRY, J.","The dispute between the parties is over the use of the name of the celebrity, late Junaid Jamshed. This order decides competing applications for temporary injunction moved in the subject suits.
2. Jazaa Foods (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter 'Jazaa Foods') is in the business of packing and distributing food items such as rice, fried onion, spices etc. It's trade mark 'Jazaa' is registered in Class 30 in respect of rice, wheat flour, flour milling products, sauces (condiments), spices etc. The late Junaid Jamshed was one of the founding members/ shareholder of Jazaa Foods and presently one of his sons is a shareholder and Director thereof. Therefore, in conjunction with it's registered trade mark 'Jazaa', the goods of Jazaa Foods bear the words 'by Junaid Jamshed', hereinafter referred to as 'the mark1 in question', albeit those words are not part of the registered trade mark of Jazaa Foods.
3. U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. is in the business of manufacturing clothing, ready-wear garments, footwear, bags, fragrances etc. bearing the trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed', which goods are then supplied by it to the company, Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd., for onward retail. Per Suit No. 94/2020, the late Junaid Jamshed was a shareholder also in Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd., and presently, his son is still shareholder. However, the registered trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed' is the property of U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd., and the company Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. is an authorized user thereof pursuant to a licence. The Defendant No.3 of Suit No. 94/2020 is the Chief Executive of both U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. and Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. (collectively 'U&I Garments'). The trade mark 'Junaid J. Jamshed' is registered not only in Classes in respect of textiles, garments, footwear and handbags, it is also registered in a number of other Classes including Class 30 (rice, spices etc.) in which the trade mark of Jazaa Foods is registered.
4. Suit No. 94/2020 has been filed by Jazaa Foods (plaintiff No.1) and by Taimur Jamshed son of late Junaid Jamshed (plaintiff No.2) inter alia for an injunction to restrain U&I Garments and others from creating hindrances or obstructions in the use by Jazaa Foods of the mark in question, and by C.M.A. No. 745/2020 they pray for a temporary injunction accordingly. It is the case of the said plaintiffs that the business of Jazaa Foods had been started by the late Junaid Jamshed along with other members; that during his lifetime Junaid Jamshed spear-headed the marketing campaign of Jazaa Foods, and in that vein, given his celebrity status, he had vide a written authorization dated 28-06-2016, permitted Jazaa Foods to use the mark in question; that Jazaa Foods has ever since been using the mark in question without any objection from U&I Garments; that in December 2019, three years after the death of the Junaid Jamshed, the Defendant No.3 who is the Chief Executive of U&I Garments, asked Jazaa Foods to obtain a licence from U&I Garments for the use of the mark in question, thus implying that unless Jazaa Foods obtains such a licence, U&I Garments would treat that as an infringement of its trade mark; and that on the refusal of Jazaa Foods to comply, the Defendant No.3 has threatened to impede and damage the business of Jazaa Foods.
5. Right after Suit No. 94/2020, U&I Garments (Pvt.) Ltd. and Junaid Jamshed (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter collectively 'U&I Garments) also filed Suit No. 124/2020 against Jazaa Foods inter alia for trade mark infringement and for passing-off. By C.M.A. No. 933/2020, U&I Garments has prayed for a temporary injunction to restrain Jazaa Foods from using the mark in question in any fashion or manner.
 with new technological evidence.","The effect of the disclaimer in the trade mark registration of U&I Garments is that unless the name 'Junaid Jamshed' is used by another in substantially the same fashion and get-up as used by U&I Garments (Table I supra), it cannot claim to be aggrieved. A comparison of the mark in question with the trade mark of U&I Garments shows that there is no similarity in the fashion and get-up of the name 'Junaid Jamshed' as used in the two marks. Therefore, in view of section 42(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, the said use by Jazaa Foods of the name 'Junaid Jamshed' would not constitute trade mark infringement. As regards the allegation of passing-off, it is settled law that an action for passing-off is essentially to protect 'property in goods' based on the reputation of those goods, as distinct from an action to protect a trade mark which is a property in itself (see Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090). ","Given the disclaimer and its effect discussed above inter alia, U&I Garments does not have a prima facie case for the grant of a temporary injunction to restrain the use of the mark in question by Jazaa Foods; the balance of convenience is not in its favour, nor would it suffer any irreparable loss if injunction is refused as apparently no action has been taken by it against the use of the mark in question by Jazaa Foods since 2016. Conversely, Jazaa Foods meets the test of the said three ingredients for the grant of a temporary injunction. Jazaa Foods has relied upon photographs to show that during his lifetime, Junaid Jamshed himself used his name (mark in question) to promote Jazaa Foods; that the mark in question is being used by Jazaa Foods at least since 2016 without objection; that Junaid Jamshed had given a written authorization to Jazaa Foods to use his name; and therefore unless the Defendants of Suit No. 94/2020 (U&I Garments and others) are restrained from interfering in the said use, Jazaa Foods is likely to suffer irreparable loss. Consequently, C.M.A. No. 933/2020 moved by the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 124/2020 is dismissed; whereas, C.M.A. No. 745/2020 moved by the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 94/2020 is granted in terms that pending suit the Defendants of Suit No. 94/2020 are restrained from interfering in the use of the mark/name 'by Jamshed Junaid' by Jazaa Foods in conjunction with their registered trademark 'Jazaa' in Class 30 in the fashion and get-up that appears in Table II supra.","In Muhammad Ashraf v. Muhammad Akram (2016 MLD 389) it was held that the principle that registration of a trade mark gives rise to a prima facie case, balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable loss, that principle would be applicable where the trade mark was registered without a disclaimer, restriction or limitation; and that where a disclaimer, restriction or limitation to the exclusive use of any word/feature/description of a trade mark is imposed pursuant to section 21 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, then such disclaimer, restriction or limitation would have to be considered while determining an application for temporary injunction.",MWA/J-10/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

I am also of the view that since prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff; it does not open to the defendants to say that they ought to be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong. Moreover, the pendency of the application of defendant No.2 for registration of his mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks will not disentitle the plaintiff being proprietor of a registered trade mark from his exclusive right to its use and that such right will be deemed to be infringed by any person who uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling to as it likely to deceive or cause confusion in view of sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance.

In the complaint it was alleged that the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's stylized and artistically created logo/trademark without the Complainant's permission or authorization or consent. The Commission initiated an enquiry pursuant to section 37(2) of the Act.  under heightened security.,"In view of the submissions made before us in the subject proceedings, following issues need deliberation:--
 
(i) whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
 
(ii) whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
 
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act,
 
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10, and
 
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
 
","The Respondents of the first category i.e. Mr. Rehan (Respondent No. 1) and ICS Courier (Respondent No. 2) were forthcoming in their conduct as discussed in Paras (36) and (37). Therefore, taking a lenient view, we are not imposing any penalty on both the Respondents; however, they are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in future, which shall otherwise entail serious consequences under the Act.
The Respondent belonging to the second category, i.e. Mr. Uzair, has also provided the documents substantiating that in fact the couriers booked by him were passed on to the Complainant and were eventually sent through the Complainant. He has also provided the details of many other undertakings using the trademark of the Complainant. Although the Respondent has assured the Commission future compliance, it is important that at least some penalty be imposed keeping in view that his practices were misleading and deceptive in terms of section 10. Particularly, the fact that he even represented himself affiliated with the Complainant by using the Complainant's trademark on his visiting card cannot be overlooked being a serious breach. Also, he did not place anything on record to demonstrate that he has discontinued such practices, after the issuance of the show cause notice. Keeping the above in view coupled with his assurance, we are restricting the penalty to Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five hundred Thousand Only).

Pervaiz Respondent No. 5) have failed in substantiating their stance and have not even demonstrated their good faith through their conduct. The contravention of section 10(1) of the Act stands established in terms of what has already been discussed above. However, we are of the view that the necessary deterrent effect would be achieved and the interests of justice served even if a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only) is imposed.
Similarly, Mr. Nauman Anwer Butt (Respondent No. 6) and Raja Asir Munir (Respondent No. 7), are doing the business in their own names i.e. DHIL and DHS respectively, yet using a logo which is deceptively similar to the Complainant's trademark for which no plausible justification has been placed forward. Based on the principles laid down by the courts in cases of 'passing off' similarity in colour, scheme, get-up, overall similarity and the broad salient features by which an ordinary illiterate customer would be misled for taking product manufactured or services rendered by defendant as that of plaintiff are the relevant factors for such determination. In our considered view in the present case, taking these factors into account we find the Respondents' marks misleading and deceptive and capable of being taken as marks of the Complainant by an ordinary consumer. On comparison these marks bear such resemblance which is likely to cause confusion and deception. It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely affect goodwill and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant's business interest; as it is in the case of all Respondents. While these Respondents are primarily using their own business names, clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 is not relevant. Nonetheless, in the given facts and circumstances, it is in the interest of justice to deter such practices and these Respondents are also held liable to pay a penalty in the sum of Rs.1,000,000 (Rupees One Million Only).
The Respondents are hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behavior in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to discontinue the use of trademark of the Complainant with immediate effect and not to use it in future without due authorization. The Respondents are also directed to file within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Order, the commitments with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene provisions of section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter, along with the penalty.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondents shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.500,000 (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
 At the end, we cannot ignore the fact that during the proceedings, details of other undertakings along with the images were provided by Mr. Uzair. The Registrar is directed to forward this concern to the OFT department of this Commission for further scrutiny and independent inquiry, if deemed necessary, in terms of section 37 of the Act.
Accordingly, the Show Cause Notices Nos. 26 to 32 of 2012 issued to the Respondents are hereby disposed of in terms of this Order.
","The complaint is filed by Company Secretary Mr. Muhammad Hanif Idrees, with the Complainant's seal and supported by Board Resolution No.12 of 2011, authorizing him and CEO Mr. Sarfaraz Siddiqui to file legal documents regarding the misuse of the DHL trademark.

The complaint is valid, containing the signature of the authorized representative and supported by a power of attorney signed by Mr. Idrees.

The objection that the complaint is not filed by an authorized representative has no merit, as proven by the resolution and signatures provided. The burden of proof that such power did not exist lies on the defendant, who failed to provide contrary evidence.

Some Respondents denied the authenticity of the images in the enquiry report and claimed to have stopped using the DHL trademark. However, these images were verified by an enquiry officer, and Respondents failed to provide rebuttal evidence within the given time.

Respondent Mr. Butt claimed the Complainant encouraged using its trademark, but provided no evidence to substantiate this.

Respondent Mr. Asif Iqbal objected to the complaint, stating it mentioned ""Asir Iqbal,"" who does not work at the site. However, evidence showed ""Asir Iqbal"" was a typographic mistake, and the complaint was indeed against Mr. Asif Iqbal.

The Respondents claimed ignorance of the Competition Act and lack of intent to deceive. However, the Complainant's trademark and logo are globally recognized, and ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

The essential function of a trademark is to guarantee the origin of goods or services to the consumer, distinguishing them from others. The use of similar logos by the Respondents aimed to capitalize on the Complainant's goodwill, misleading consumers.

The Complainant's trademark is registered in Pakistan and over 220 countries, representing swiftness and speed.

Fraudulent use of the trademark involves misrepresentation to deceive consumers for an advantage, which the Respondents knew or should have known was unauthorized.

The conduct of the Respondents violates section 10(1) of the Act, with varying penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and the conduct of the Respondents.

Respondents Mr. Rehan and ICS Courier, who discontinued using the trademark promptly, are not penalized but are reprimanded not to commit such contravention in the future.

ITALFARMACO S.P.A.---Petitioner
Versus
HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","C.O. No. 751 of 2010, decided on 17th May, 2017.",,,"An application under section 90(1)(b)(i) and section 80(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance"") has been filed by the applicant-company Italfarmaco S.P.A, a company existing under the laws of Italy through its authorized signatory (""the applicant""). The application has been filed for a declaration of invalidity of the entry in the Trademark Register of the trademark FERPLEX registered under No.130807 dated July 11, 1995 in class 5 for pharmaceutical preparations used as iron supplement. The trademark FERPLEX (""the trademark"") has been registered in the name of the respondent No.1 Himont Pharmaceuticals (""Himont"").
A license agreement dated 26.10.1994 was executed between the applicant and Himont regarding the manufacturing and sale of the trademark. The agreement is annexed with the application. The primary facts which form the foundation of the application are not in dispute between the parties and the parties are on common ground with regard thereto. Thus, the registration of the trademark in the name of Himont since the year 1996 was within the knowledge of the applicant and the position continued to subsist until the filing of the application for declaring the trademark as invalid. The license agreement between the parties was terminated by the applicant vide termination letter dated 27.4.2009.
It can be seen from a reading of the prayer clause of the suit filed by Himont that the suit seeks a declaration ""regarding the trademark FERPLEX"". The suit by Himont also seeks a declaration to the effect that exclusive agreement between the applicant and Himont is still valid and enforceable as also that Himont has the sole right to manufacture, market, supply, distribute and sale of the product FERPLEX in Pakistan. On 6.9.2010, the applicant also filed a suit before the District Court, Lahore under the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by the Ordinance. The suit by the applicant is for the grant of permanent injunction seeking to restrain Himont purportedly from infringing and using the trademark FERPLEX. Therefore, the suit by the applicant is also with regard to the trademark which is the subject matter of this application as well. It would be expedient to reproduce the prayer made in the suit by the applicant, which is as follow:-
""This honourable Court may further be pleased to pass/grant/direct:
a) An order directing the Defendant to recall all the stocks of its products from the market being sold under the imitated trademark FERPLEX as well as for destruction or replacement of the labels, plates, markings thereof along with destruction or handing over to the plaintiff for destruction of all the offending labels, plates, markings and other printed material bearing the imitated trademark FERPLEX.
b) To remove all figures, hoarding, boards, neon signs etc., bearing imitated trademark FERPLEX.
c) An order directing the Defendant to get all its Marketing Approval/Drug Registration for imitated trademark FERPLEX transferred to the name of the plaintiff.
d) Any other relief that this honourable Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the present case.""
Once again, it is evident from the prayer reproduced above that the injunction has been sought with regard to the trademark FERPLEX and ancillary reliefs have been asked for which inter alia include an order directing the defendant to have all its marketing approval/drug registration transferred to the name of the applicant. with a different defendant.","It is correct that Himont was a licensee of the applicant under a license agreement executed on 26.10.1994. The agreement has effectively been terminated w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Himont alleges that the agreement could not be terminated and has brought a suit before the District Court, Lahore. The parties are at variance with regard to the fact whether the agreement gave the power to Himont to have the trademark registered in its name. The parties are poles apart on the interpretation put on the different clauses of the license agreement with regard to this aspect. The applicant asserts that by the license agreement, Himont was merely conferred a license for the use of trademark FERPLEX within the territory of Pakistan. The applicant provided requisite data and information to Himont to enable it to obtain marketing approval/drug registration under the trademark FERPLEX and based on the information and data provided by the applicant, Himont succeeded in obtaining market registration from the applicant for formulating, manufacturing and selling the FERPLEX products as licensee of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the trademark was registered with the Registrar of Trademark in the name of Himont and the current application has been made by the applicant to declare as invalid the registration of the trademark."," In view of the above, C.M No.1-C of 2011 is allowed. The application is hereby returned to the applicant to be filed before the appropriate forum.
","Two grounds form the nub of the applicant's arguments with regard to the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by Himont. These grounds revolve around the true construction of provisions of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. Firstly, the learned counsel states that in fact no proceedings are pending with the District Court within the contemplation of the term as used in subsection (4) and thus, the exception to subsection (4) is not attracted so as to convince this Court to allow the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. Secondly, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the purposive construction of subsection (4) was that the choice to approach the appellate forum was retained by the applicant who brings an application under section 80 for seeking a declaration of invalidity with regard to a trademark.
the application may be made by an interested party either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thus far, the choice lies with an interested party to file an application either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thereafter follows an exception which has been provided in subsection (4). In terms of that exception if the proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court the application shall be made to the High Court or a District Court. The learned counsel for the applicant laid great stress on the aspect that the proceedings before the District Court were not proceedings within the ambit of the term as used in clause 'a' of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. This submission of the learned counsel is nuanced and has no legal legs to stand upon. The term 'proceedings' is a compendious term and includes all or any causes which are brought before the courts and on which the courts can undertake judicial proceedings. It would suffice to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as the State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) for an elaboration to the term 'proceedings'. It was held that:-
""Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, interpretation of the word 'proceeding' as interpreted in various pronouncements given above, we are of the opinion that the word 'proceedings' is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" means the instituting or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a 'proceeding' is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or judicial officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an action.""
The learned counsel for the applicant attempted to make a subtle distinction on an issue which arises peripherally from the first submission made by the learned counsel with regard to the meaning of the term 'proceedings'. He stated that the proceedings before the District Court were not regarding the use of the trademark but merely sought the cancellation of the registration of the drug with the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan. n order to understand the proposition raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, the prayers made in the suits filed by the parties before the District Court, Lahore have been brought forth above. In this application, the prayer is to the effect that the trademark registration be declared as invalid in terms of section 90(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and in the alternate it has been prayed that registration of trademarks be rectified by substituting the name of the applicant as the proprietor of the registered trademark. Therefore, the entire prayer of the applicant constitutes a request for a declaration of invalidity with regard to the trademark registered in the name of Himont. If we were to juxtapose the prayers made in this application with the one made by Himont in its suit before District Court, Lahore it would become evident that Himont has prayed for the converse of what the applicant has prayed in the instant application. 
It is under these circumstances that inter alia a declaration has been sought in the suit for the continued use of the trademark FERPLEX by Himont as also for a declaration that any use of the trademark FERPLEX by any party including the defendant shall be an act of unfair competition and in violation of Himont's commercial and equitable rights. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any of its agents from obstructing the business of Himont has also been sought. More importantly, a decree for permanent injunction has been sought restraining the applicant herein either directly or indirectly from using the trademark FERPLEX in Pakistan in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the relief claimed in the suit filed by Himont is in conflict and directly contrary to what has been asked for in the present application. 
The learned counsel for the applicant made a reference to section 72 of the Trademark Act, 1940 and referred to the words ""as the case may be"" as used in section 72 of the Act, 1940. He also referred to section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 in which in subsection (4)(a) while making a similar exception the legislature has used the words ""as the case may be"". Precisely, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the absence of these words has left a choice with the applicant to make the application to either the High Court or the District Court. This argument by the learned counsel will virtually have the effect of nullifying the intention of the legislature in providing an exception and will make the entire exception as redundant. It is trite principle and a rule of construction that redundancy cannot be attached to any provisions enacted by the legislature. If the argument of the learned counsel were to be accepted, this will mean that the application may be filed with the High Court or a District Court irrespective of the proceedings pending in the High Court or a District Court. This will have the unholy effect of making a mockery of the law and, therefore, such an interpretation could not be countenanced.
The wrongness of the argument is also evident from a consideration of the provisions of section 73 of the Ordinance. Section 73, so far as relevant, reads as under:-
73(4) An application for revocation may be made by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-
a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in case the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Subsection (4) confers the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for revocation on the Registrar. Thus, and it requires to be reemphasized, the power vests in the Registrar and nor in either the High Court or the District Court. 
The exception is couched in broad terms. The words ""if proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or, the District Court "" evince a broad-based and wide-ranging concept which is inclusive. From the meaning of the term 'proceedings' brought out in the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, there is no doubt that it embraces within it the suits filed by the parties before the District Court and the current application too. But the key word in any opinion is 'concerning'. It connotes all or any proceedings even remotely touching upon the trademark in question. The word renders the entire concept fluid and plastic without being hedged in, in any manner. If the proceedings are brought under the provisions of the Ordinance, they are necessarily proceedings concerning trademark, whether they arise out of a contact or are brought for revocation of registration or for declaring as invalid the registration of a trademark. In this case, Himont resists the application for invalidity, tooth and nail. It seeks both the license agreement and the registration to be declared as valid in the suit before the District Court. The applicant says that retention of the registration of trademark is not a specific prayer in the suit filed by Himont. That may be so but the effect of declaring the license agreement to be subsisting and valid would have the consequence of impacting the question of registration too and there is no escape from it. The use of the word 'shall' too lends actuality to the analysis and clearly brings forth the mandatory nature of the provision.
As if this was not enough, the legislature enacted section 116 to reinforce the purpose of bringing in the exception in subsection (4) of section 80. Section 116 is to the following effect:-
""116. Procedure in certain cases of option to apply to the High Court, a District Court or the Registrar- Where under this Ordinance, an applicant has the option of making an application either to the High Court or a District Court or to the Registrar-
a) if any suit or proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending before the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in any other case, if the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Once again, section 116 conceptualises the same statutory enterprise and is an overarching provision which applies to all applications made under the Ordinance. It seeks to attain the same end, that is, all decisions concerning a trademark should be consistent and made by the same forum.
The learned counsel for the applicant relied upon Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Rafiuddin v. Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 2 others (1994 MLD 874) and Iqbal Begum v. Farooq Inayat and others (PLD 1993 Lahore 183). These judgments elaborate upon the concept and contours of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary to allude to these precedents as the concept is very well settled and the issue regarding the applicability or otherwise of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. does not arise as it is not denied that in these proceedings the general provisions of civil procedure apply and in case this Court comes to the conclusion that the present proceedings are caught by the mischief of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance, this Court has the power to make necessary directions in order to give effect to those provisions and there is no cavil with this proposition.
The learned counsel for Himont referred to Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833) which was a case concerning application under section 73 of the Ordinance for the revocation of the trademark. It was held in this judgment that the application ought to be filed with the Registrar and the only exception which allows the filing of such an application before the High Court if proceedings were already pending with the High Court. This precedent can be cited as a complete answer to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has a choice to file the proceedings either before the High Court or before the District Court. Messrs H & B, General Trading Company through Director v. Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028) is a Division Bench judgment of the Karachi High Court which held that proceedings under sections 73 and 80 of the Ordinance require such proceedings to be filed before the forum where proceedings concerning the trademark is already pending. This judgment is on all fours with the facts in the instant application and primarily supports the findings rendered in the instant application. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that all such proceedings must be decided by the same forum and this was based on sound principles of administration of justice and judicial governance and proceeded thereafter to return the application to be filed at the proper forum. The appeal before the Division Bench arose out of a judgment of the Single Bench of the Karachi High Court reported as 2009 CLC 354 which substantially arrived at the same conclusion which was affirmed by the Division Bench.",KMZ/I-18/L Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 due to a change in law.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

JAVED AKHTAR CHAUHAN---Plaintiff
 
Versus
 
MUMTAZ ALI and 2 others---Defendants
 

","Suit No.2595 of 2014, decided on 19th November, 2015.",,,"Learned counsel for plaintiff contends that plaintiff is having registered trade mark of POWER SONIC in the name of Javed Akhter Chauhan Trading as ""Javedan Resources Corporation"" since then plaintiff is carrying business, under that title whereas defendants have no right to continue their business on the same trade mark, such trade mark is only registered in the name of the plaintiff. Albeit, defendant No.3 is claiming the same trade mark as registered in USA but such certificate is not appended with the written statement or the counter affidavit. He contends that there is no issue of authorization of agency but in instant suit issue of trade mark is involved. He also refers section 73, subsection (3) of sections 80, 86 and 96 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. It is also contended that defendants 2 and 3 have not sought permission to run their business in Pakistan hence their application is without any substance and grounds taken in their application, are not falling within the parameters of section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. He relied upon PLD 2000 Karachi 139, 2007 CLC 1610 and 2003 PLC 26.
In contra, learned counsel for defendants Nos.2 and 3 contends that plaintiff was agent of defendants Nos.2 and 3 up-to 2009/2010 and thereafter on same trade mark he got registration in Pakistan hence under Paris Convention of Intellectual Property, 1833 rights of the defendants are protected; while referring emails and documents submitted with counter affidavit emphasis that plaintiff was their agent and continuously remained in contact with defendants with regard to such business. with a different defendant.","Since name and style of trade mark is not disputed but question, before this Court as raised by respective parties, appears to be confined to the extent of registration of same trade mark in Pakistan in favour of plaintiff with reference to 'Paris convention' and applicability thereof within object of Chapter-X of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. A proper respond to the issue, would require a reference to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of the plaint which are as under:-
That defendant No.3 is a company carrying on business at California, U.S.A. It gets the batteries and battery cells manufactured from the Peoples Republic of China & Vietnam and import them to the U.S.A. The batteries and battery cells are labeled under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label and thereafter they are shipped to Pakistan. The goods were also shipped from Republic of China & Vietnam to Pakistan. The plaintiff was carrying on business with it and was their representative in Pakistan until the year 2009-2010.
That thereafter the relations between them became strained and the defendant No.3 started exporting its goods to defendants Nos. 1 and 2 under the trade mark POWER SONIC Label.
That the marks POWER SONIC Label of the plaintiff and POWER SONIC Label of the defendants are identical with each other, visually as well as phonetically. Besides this, the design, get up and colour scheme of both the marks are identical, thus causing confusion and deception during the course of trade.
From bare reading of the above paragraphs of the pleadings of the plaintiff himself (itself) following facts are prima facie admitted i.e.:
i) defendant No.3 continuously has been exporting its product under marks 'POWER SONIC' from California etc.;
ii) plaintiff has been in active knowledge and notice that defendant No.1 is carrying its business under such mark;
iii) plaintiff has been selling product of the defendant No.1 as 'agent' of defendant No.3;
iv) mark of plaintiff, though got registered, is identical to that of defendant No.3 with each other visually as well as phonetically;","It is quite safe to say that no prima facie case or balance of convenience is available to the plaintiff, rather application, so filed by the plaintiff, is devoid of substance which accordingly is dismissed. On the other hand since, the mark of the defendant No.3 is 'well known mark in Pakistan', and is protected by Chapter-X of the Ordinance hence application of the defendant No.3 is allowed which otherwise is within scope and object of section 86(3). However, plaintiff is at liberty to approach Registrar for fresh registration of its independent mark.
","It is safe to say that it is not disputed that plaintiff was agent of defendants with regard to same business and even under the trade mark ""Power Sonic"" labels he was carrying out by receiving shipments. Now, to examine the applicability of Chapter-X of the Ordinance would require reference to sections 85, 86 and 92 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The owner of a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention as a well-known trade mark shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Pakistan of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical or deceptively similar to the well-known trade mark-
(a) in relation to identical or similar goods or services, where the use is likely to cause confusion; or
(b) where such use causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the well-know trade mark.
(4) Rights conferred under subsection (3) shall be subject to the provisions of section 81 and nothing in the said subsection shall effect the continuation of any bona fide use of a trade mark begun before the commencement of this Ordinance.
Trade name.---A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not.
Perusal of section 85 categorical suggests that Pakistan is the signatory of Paris Convention and is a Convention country. Definition of ""Paris Convention"" means that ""Paris convention for the protection of industrial property of the 20th March, 1833"". The 'Paris convention' was also a step to ensure protection to 'well-known marks' in all signatory countries even if they (trade-marks) are not literally registered in all countries. The inclusion of Chapter-X in the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is itself an admission to vitality of such aspect particularly when it assures protection but to 'well known marks'. At this juncture, I would insist that the bare reading of the section 86(1)(b), in existence of admitted positions, is sufficient to bring the mark of the defendant No.3 as 'well known in Pakistan'. Once it is prima facie established that a 'mark' is qualifying the meaning of 'well-known in Pakistan' it shall be entitled to all protections 'available to such 'mark'. Since name and style is not disputed and question of registration is categorically defined in section 92 with regard to trade name, which provides that ""A trade name shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration under this Ordinance whether it forms part of a trade mark or not."" I am equally conscious with object of the Section 90 of the Ordinance but such plea is not taken by the plaintiff that plaintiff got the registration of mark of defendant No.3 in his (plaintiff's) favour within notice and knowledge of the defendant No.3 or that defendant No.3 has acquiesced such registration of its 'mark' in favour of the plaintiff. On the other hand, the plaintiff himself admitted that on becoming relations strained between plaintiff and defendant No.3, the defendant No.3 started shipping its product to defendants Nos.1 and 2. Needless to add that even while resorting to procedure of section 90, the plaintiff was legally required to have made this fact clear within notice and knowledge of the 'Registrar' so as to allow an opportunity of hearing to defendant No.3 to oppose such registration of its mark because the provision of section 90(a) leaves the Registrar with no discretion to register such 'mark' where proprietor opposes such registration. The admission of plaintiff that defendant No.3 has been continuing its business under same mark is sufficient to indicate its intention to enjoy privileges, available to such mark, under Convention of 1833. At this moment, it would be noteworthy to add here that if such practice is allowed then in every country any agent or other person would start that practice by getting registration from that area by taking the benefits of goodwill attached with such well-known mark. If so, it would mean nothing but a negation of the Convention which otherwise provides protection to the creator and such scheme as enshrined is to save the rights of intellectual property. Not only this but such agent shall become entitled to the fruits of the name and good-will attached with such 'mark' which cannot be allowed to happen because the name and good-will are not earned/established over-nights by mere preparing a product alone but the efforts and finance which make that 'mark' to stand in the market with its own name.",MH/J-16/Sindh Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

Versus
MUHAMMAD FAHIM---Respondent

","H.C.A. No. 269 of 2014, decided on 3rd May, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Brief facts of the case are that the appellant manufactures and sells syrup under the coined name Rooh Afza for decades and have had the said trademark registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (the 1940 Act) in the British India on 03.08.1942 in class 32. Various versions of the said trademark have been regularly registered by the appellant and from the details provided, we note that about eight registration between years 1961 upto 1984 have been sought by the appellant in respect of the said trademark giving rise to contention that the appellant is very alert in respect of protection and enforcement of its rights in the said trademark. Being a household name used for over a half century, the said trademark has acquired extreme popularity, which also attracts new incumbents to disguise their trademarks and trade-dress similar or confusingly similar to that of the appellant. The appellant's counsel contended that the Appellant became aware of the respondent's intended use of its trademark on 29.06.2014 when the latter advertised its products in the daily Dawn newspaper. Being alerted with the deceptive name and confusing similarities in the label used by the respondent, it was clear that the respondent intended to deceive the customers of the appellant and to take benefit of the hard earned reputation and market space created by the appellant for over 73 years; the appellant commenced legal action which culminated in its filing of the instant suit against the respondent on account of alleged infringement and passing off of appellant's well-known trademark by the respondent. Along with the said suit, the appellant filed an application seeking injunction against the respondent, while an interim injunction was granted to the appellant, however, in terms of the impugned order, the earlier injunction granted was dismissed.
The counsel for the appellant brought to our attention an application moved by the respondent for registration of its trademark filed at the Trademarks Registry bearing No.316901 dated 22.03.2012 in class 30. The learned counsel contended that when advertised, the said application was also opposed by the appellant which opposition bearing No.1662/2013 is still pending adjudication by the Registrar of Trademarks.
From the documents, we of course see that the respondent has also attempted to protect Rooh-e-Samar trademark under the copyright laws by making an application on 10.04.2014, we are not sure about the fate of the said application, however, even if registered that does not give any right to use the said label by the respondent in respect of any goods.
The counsel for the respondent, on the other hand placed heavy reliance on the grounds leveled in the impugned order and tried to take us at microscopic level to show minute difference between the rival marks (e.g. colour of grapes being green in the appellant's mark, while grapes of red colour appear in the respondent's mark) as well as the learned counsel contended that the calligraphy used by the respondent is of different style as compared to that of the appellant. Counsel also contended that while oranges appearing on respondent's wrapper is with skin, the appellant's orange is pealed! While counsel came with many astonishing contentions, one of it included mentioning of Article 18 of the Constitution, which provided for freedom of trade as well as to the novel contention that while customers of appellant's trademark are repeat customers and they purchase the appellant's products by using the brand name Roof Afza, while the respondent being a new entrant in the market, it has only first time buyers who after satisfied with the product place repeat orders. The counsel also stated that since the appellant's trademark is so popular that consumers ask for it by name, no confusion or deception could take place as respondent's trademark has not reached to that level of popularity and it is only purchased as Lal-Shurbat or by its own name Rooh-e-Samar. The counsel loaded us through a series of judgments, where Courts have held the trademark having different suffix and prefix can co-exist. He, inter alia, cited the examples of Coca-cola and Pepsi-cola in support of his client's case, which to us are of no influential value since we are dealing here with a mark that is probably most powerful Pakistani brand with unparalleled repute and domestic heritage and have achieved 6bis well-known trademark's protection under section 86 of the Trade Marks Ordinance 2001. with new evidence presented.","Courts in a number of cases (2012 CLD 226, 2003 CLD 794, 2000 MLD 2057, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1987 MLD 2569, PLD 1970 Karachi 537, PLD 1969 Karachi 376, PLD 1958 Karachi 481) have discussed methods of finding confusion and deception in relation to rival trade marks primarily relying on the age-old and fundamental 'reaping without sowing' concept evolved in respect of trademarks in the year 1880 pursuant to the House of Lords judgment in the case of Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog (18 CD 396) holding that no man has a right to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader and he cannot, therefore, in the language of Lord Langdale, in the case of Perry v. Truefitt, (6 Beay. 66) be allowed to use names, marks or other indicia, by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person. Over the years some standard tests have been established in this regard. Most famous of these include ""Moron in a Hurry"" and ""Lapp"" tests arising out of Morning Star Cooperative Society v. Express Newspapers Limited (1979 FSR 113) and Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 F.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1983) respectively; and the famous age-old ""Classic Trinity"" test. We will apply all these three tests in the case at hand.
With regards Classic Trinity, courts are required to consider following three aspects of the rival parties:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused (or to be caused) to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.
As one can see, classic trinity test, in a broader way, considers the same factors which the Lapp test does and now when we read all these tests in the light of the 1888 foundation judgment in the Singer case, the moral of all these tests remains the same. No one is allowed to put off his goods as the goods of a rival trader by using names, marks or other indicia by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person.","The instant appeal is allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the respondent, its servants, agents, representatives and all persons claiming through it, are restrained from infringing the appellant's registered trademark Rooh Afza and Label in any manner by selling, marketing, offering for sale, advertising or otherwise using on its syrup trade mark Rooh-e-Samar either alone or in conjunction with any other mark, words, figures or devices.
","Beside the above tests, another important aspect that courts need to look at while considering rival trademarks for the possibility of passing test of infringement or passing off is to consider 'get-up' of the rival goods. A Practical Guide to Trade Mark Law by Amanda Michaels (Oxford University Press) defines 'Get-up' as the appearance of a trader's goods which are recognized by the customers. These features of appearance include the size, shape and colour schemes of a product as well as distinctive packaging or the arrangement of labels or the fascia, layout and fitting of a shop. 
Accordingly, get-up is often relied upon by a claimant in addition to the name or the trademark alone. In the instant case also, when we compare get-up of the rival products, we see clear resemblances. These include identical caps, ribs at the bottom of the bottle, word ""ROOH"" as predominant feature of the respondent's label, devices of fruits and the placement of wrapper at the same place as that on the appellant's products. Thus the overall impression left in the mind of an unwary purchaser is nearly the same. One must keep in mind that a person (urban shopper) sees or hears about more than 1500 trade marks in a day (Law for Business by M. M Sulphey and Az-Har Basheer - PHI Learning 2013) and thus not each and every microscopic element of each brand resides in a person's mind. There is a very limited sketch of a brand's get-up that resides in the mind of a purchaser, therefore courts need to come forward and protect that hazy picture developed in the mind of a purchaser by the owner of the original trade mark.
In the light of the foregoing where all three tests produce results favouring the appellant, we are of the view that use of the intended trademark, trade dress and get-up by the respondent infringes common-law right of the Appellants as well as their statutory rights provided pursuant to its registration and continuous use of its Rooh Afza trademark and trade-dress.","

Competition Commission of Pakistan,"Before Justice (Retd.) Mian Fasih ul Mulk, Chairperson, Ahmed Owais Pirzada, Member Technical and Justice (Retd.) Miftah-ud-Din, Member Technical
Raja ASIR MUNIR and another---Appellants
Versus
Messrs DHL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED and 2 others---Respondents

","Appeals Nos. 1 and 2 of 2013, decided on 23rd May, 2017.",,"AHMED OWAIS PIRZADA, MEMBER TECHNICAL.","Briefly the background of the appeals is that the Competition Commission of Pakistan received a complaint from respondent No. 1, alleging fraudulent use of its stylized and artistically created logo trademark by the appellants without any permission or authorization or consent of the respondent, which being false, deceptive and misleading and also capable of harming its business was in violation to the provision of section 10 of the Act. The Commission conducted an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Act, concluding that both the appellants used the logo, which were identical in colour and style of the complainant's trademark on the bill board/hording/sign board for advertisement, which prima facie gave an impression that the appellants were authorized dealers of the complainant, which was not correct impression, hence such use of mark which was identical to the respondent's trademark, prima facie was misleading the consumer and was also capable of harming the business interest of the respondent in violation of section 10 of the Act. The report recommended that the conduct of the appellants warranted initiation of proceedings against them under section 30 of the Act.
3. Based on the prima facie findings of the inquiry report, show cause notices were issued to the appellants on 22nd February, 2012, pursuance to which appellants and all other parties were afforded an opportunity of a detailed hearing. Finally the Competition Commission of Pakistan concluded that the manner in which marks under question were printed and advertised look deceptively similar to that of respondent's trademark. Consequently the appellants were penalized vide order dated 21st December, 2012 which had been impugned in the instant appeals.
4. In their appeals the appellants stated that the impugned order dated 21st December, 2012, passed by Competition Commission of Pakistan was illegal, against the law and facts of the case on record and passed arbitrarily. It was stated that neither font, colour did have any resemblance with the respondent's trademark nor style has any similarity with the styled trademark of the respondent. It was further stated that the impugned order was without jurisdiction and not sustainable in the eyes of law. The appellants stated in their appeals that the inquiry report and even the order passed had failed to bear out any misleading information being passed by the appellants or any impression which was basically different from actual one, in clear term there was no deception in using the word IDHS international couriers. The appellants stated in their appeals that from the plain language of section 10(b) of the Competition Act, it was apparent that the lawmakers divided the allegation in to distribution of false or misleading information and distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis related to character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or quality of goods while in the instant case there is no distribution of any false or misleading information and no such information was passed on to the customers regarding the DHL World Wide Express, which affected the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or concern the qualities of goods. The appellants took the position that the complaint was not properly instituted, signed and verified by the competent and authorized person. PLD 1971 Supreme Court page 550 was referred in this behalf. Further, the complaint, which was filed with wrong name of the appellant's company, was not having affidavit with it before the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It was stated that the appellants were neither using the trademark nor distributing false or misleading information regarding the fact that the appellants were authorized/permitted by the respondent. It was further stated that very important questions of law and facts were involved in the matter which could not be adjudicated upon without recording the evidence of both the parties. The pleadings were itself not evidence, it should be proved after recording evidence which was not brought on record.
5. Learned counsel for IDHS while reiterating the position taken in the appeal stated that ""IDHS international couriers"" was a trademark having trademark No-333053 and applied copy right registration with the concerned department. The trademark authority and the copy right authority under the relevant legislation has power upon the case where DHL World Wide Express registered its trademark and copyrights, therefore, the order in the given circumstances was without jurisdiction. Learned counsel further stated that the appellant never accepted, received, dispatched or delivered the goods with the name of respondent. The appellant never presented himself as agent, distributor or employee of the respondent. The learned counsel further stated that the appellant neither developed a web page, letter head, visiting cards, pamphlets, brushers, leaflets, booklets, e-mail ID by the name of respondent nor found in any correspondence or communications with the name of respondent with any third party. Thus the inquiry report, show cause notice and the subsequent order is without any basis lacking material evidence and liable to be set aside in the interest of justice.
 in a different city.","After completing the aforesaid exercise we are of the view that the following issues are to be examined for orders.
(i) Whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
(ii) Whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 and
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
(iii) Whether the order of the Competition Commission is bad in the eyes of law.
","In the circumstances, after analyzing the relevant facts and material available on record, we have come to the conclusion that finding recorded by Competition Commission of Pakistan are based on proper appraisal of relevant provisions of Competition Law as well as other material brought on record. The same are, therefore, maintained.
The appeals of the appellants, therefore, being devoid of merits are dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

 
","The issue that whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person has thoroughly been examined by the Competition Commission of Pakistan, however since the same has again been raised by the appellants, therefore, we have also looked into it. The perusal of record reveals that Mr. Nouman Anwer Butt raised the issue that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, it was noted that the complaint was filed by the Company Secretary namely Mr. Muhammad Haneef Idrees, which was not only bearing the signatures but also beard the seal of the respondent's undertaking. A certified true copy of Board Resolution No. 12/2011 by circulation passed on 17th August, 2011 was also annexed with the complaint. In the said Board Resolution along with Company Secretary, Mr. Sarfaraz Sadiqui, Chief Executive Officer of the company was also authorized on behalf of company in the matter to take all necessary measures, required in this regard before the Competition Commission of Pakistan and all courts, arbitrators, Tribunal, Forum or Administrative Authority in relation to the said matter. 
Before examining the remaining issues including contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act, we would like to deal with certain objections raised by the respondents. The trademark authority and the copyright authority under the relevant legislation have the power upon the case where ""DHL World Wide Express"" registered its trademark and copy right, therefore, the impugned order in the given circumstances is without jurisdiction. The aforesaid issue has been examined and it has been observed that involvement of a person in violation of provisions of the Competition Act provides necessary jurisdiction to the Commission to take cognizance in such type of situation for necessary orders. In these circumstances, the objection raised by Raja Asir Munir is totally uncalled for and unjustified.
Now coming to the issue that whether the appellants have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general or in particular, learned counsel for IDHS and DHIL have been asked to explain the logical reasoning and justification for adoption of marks IDHS and DHIL, however both of them could not give any justification which could be considered convincing to have mark almost identical to DHL. On the other hand a company was incorporated by three friends, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn having DHL as an essential part of company name and also used as a trademark. It is, therefore, observed that mark having resemblance with DHL is intentionally selected to confuse the market. Again the aforesaid logo has a lot of similarity with DHL.
As regards the contravention of the provision of the section 10 of the Act in general or particular, one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trademark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. To analyze the provision of section 10 more conveniently the said section 10(2)(d) is reproduced as below:-
""fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name and product labeling or packaging""
Coming to the third issue that whether the order of the Competition Commission of Pakistan is bad in the eyes of law being against the fact and passed arbitrarily. The appellants have failed to explain as to why and how the order passed by the Competition Commission could be illegal and how it is against the law and facts of the case and passed arbitrarily. Such statements without any cogent arguments and corroborative case law remain inconsequential to the appeals. Further the contention of the appellants that the Competition Commission has passed the order without having jurisdiction to do so is incorrect. It is observed that since the appellants have been involved in violation of the provisions of Competition Act, 2010, therefore, the Commission has the necessary jurisdiction and the case has been validly and competently filed and decided by the Commission.

ALLE'NORA BEAUTY SALON AND PARLOUR through Partner and others---Appellants
 
Versus
 
Mrs. QURAT-UL-AIN MANSOOR and others---Respondents
 

","H.C.As. Nos.151, 152 and 153 of 2015, decided on 10th February, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","The appellant, a partnership firm established in the year 2002 for providing beauty salon and parlor services in Karachi claims to have commenced its business since its inception under the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"". On the other hand, the respondent claims to have set up beauty salon and parlor in Lahore as early as 1990 and contends that the appellant was her employee when Alle'nora commenced its branch operations in Karachi in 2002. The dispute between the parties is in relation to trade mark and trade name (hereinafter referred to as trade mark) ""ALLE'NORA"" used by them which has resulted in three suits and counter suits agitated by one against the other. The above referred impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge was passed accordingly in respect of all three suits heard together adjudicating claim as to the ownership of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark between the said two contestants. An analytical look at the impugned judgment depicts that the learned Single Judge has very carefully crafted three important issues, being (i) which of the parties is a prior user of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Pakistan; (ii) has any of the parties a right to the exclusive use of the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" anywhere in Pakistan; and (iii) is the prior user so determined is entitled to the relief claimed in their respective suits?
 The admitted facts are that the respondent has established that it has a prior use commencing from the year 1990 in Lahore in respect of the above referred trade mark, as well as, it has also registered the said trade mark with the Trade Mark Registry, Government of Pakistan in Class 44 effective from 29.07.2006. On the other hand, the appellant as stated to in the foregoing, upon creation of its partnership in 2002 admits to have commenced use of trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" in Karachi and has filed an application for registration of trade mark on 14.11.2006 and an application for registration of copyright with the Pakistan Copyright Registry on the same date, which applications are pending. It cannot be ignored that in both the said applications, the applicants has claimed use of the said trade mark since 2002 only.
 under heightened security.","While we observe that the order of the learned Single Judge has very aptly addressed to the various issues raised by the counsel of the appellant, however, the following two contentions of the counsel crave for further deliberations:
 (a) The ingredients and test required to establish honest and concurrent use of trade marks; and
 (b) The defense of geographical distances while using another trader's trade mark.
","We, therefore, do not find any force in the assertion either that someone else's trade mark could be used in another part of the country just because the original trader had decided not to open the branch or put his presence in other part of the country or the goods carrying with trade mark are not made available to some other parts within the country. These appeals thus have no merit.
These are the reasons of short order passed in Court on 10.02.2016 dismissing the above referred appeals.","With regard to the first issue, the learned counsel relied on the above referred 1947 judgment, which has been distinguished by us as to its limitation towards latter's applicability in the instant case. Thus the above citation does not satisfy us. It is an established global understanding that the key concept behind trade mark jurisdiction revolves around protection against confusion, deception and fraud. The very purpose an honest trader choses a distinctive or novel trade mark is to keep his goods or service distant from the possibility of being taken as a competitor's goods or services. The very reasons for the creation of an intellectual property legal system is to provide for a mechanism for the protection and offering rewards to creativity and fair trade. 
In the instant case, the trade mark in question is ""ALLE'NORA"", which admittedly was first used by the respondent in Lahore as early as 1990, and was used by the appellant, who admittedly commenced their business in Karachi in the year 2002. One can easily understand that in the year 2002 when the appellant commenced their business in Karachi, they had on their drawing board (or computer screens) a copy of ""ALLE'NORA"" trade mark used by the respondent in Lahore. The appellant decided to select the said trade mark of the respondent in identical type-font, colors and calligraphy with the sole objective to get benefit from the existence of the respondent's earlier trade mark existing in the market place and to reap benefits from the well-earned reputation of the said trade mark. When the counsel for the appellant was asked to satisfy this Court as to why each and every essential element of the respondent's trade mark is present in the trade mark used or proposed to be used by the appellant, the learned counsel had no answer except to say it is purely by co-incidence, he, however tried to defend his case by alleging that even if the appellant has used each and every essential feature, font, colour and style of the respondent's trade mark, but his client has put her name (Aliya Tipu) in the trade mark ""ALLE'NORA"" to distinguish her business apart from the possibility of creation of any confusion between the ""ALLE'NORA"" of Lahore and ""ALLE'NORA"" of Karachi. The Court reverted holding that the very fact that a trader uses a prominent or substantial part of some body's else trade mark with a prefix, suffix or with any other element along with the earlier trade mark, all he is doing is to admit to the existence of the prior trade mark, and trying to come under the umbrella of the earlier trade mark attempting to fool the general public that his goods and services are as good as these provided by the owner of the earlier trade mark, but he is not the original person. 
In today's world, reputation and goodwill of a trade spreads at the speed of light. The goodwill acquired by the respondent in Lahore is not necessarily limited to that city where the services were available. The admitted fact is that these services were duly advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and internet having circulation to all over the country, and even abroad. It is also an established view in trade mark jurisdiction that goodwill or reputation does not depend upon the availability of goods/services any more. We would even come to the extent to say that even if a manufacturer or service provider suspends his business activity in a particular part of the country, the cloud of the reputation and goodwill stays there even afterwards, unless it is washed away by the winds of change. The Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is based on equitable principles wherein if a person by hard work had established a goodwill or reputation in one part of the country, the law in terms of Section 1(2) protects such reputation and goodwill throughout Pakistan. The relevant territory under the said Ordinance is the whole of Pakistan and that the relevant public consisted of both the general public and interested customers across the country.
 Notwithstanding a registered trade mark, even in cases where the trade mark is not registered, reputation and goodwill in a trade mark can be protected, pursuant to the procedure laid down in the said Ordinance by granting an option of filing a passing off action. For this reason, the legal system is built upon protecting the hard work, ingenuity and goodwill of a person who is first one to use a trade mark, trade name or any other similar source identifier (including domain name, etc.) from the attacks made by competitors. The established legal principle that whenever rights in a trade mark (whether registered or not), are attacked, the wheel of the legal system will spin in the direction of protecting the honest and first adopter in order to safeguard his hard earned reputation and as well as to save customers from such disguise.
 In this regard, the age-old principles set by the apex Court formulated in Tabaq Restaurant (Lahore) v. Tabaq Restaurant (Rawalpindi) in 1987 SCMR 1090 are beacon of guidance. The dispute, as the titles suggests, was in relation to use of Tabaq trade mark in Lahore of any earlier date, which was adopted by a competing restaurant in Rawalpindi. The apex Court laid down the principle that notwithstanding the geographical distances, a trade mark owner receives protection against use of his mark by another in such a away as is likely to lead consumers to associate the other's goods with the trade mark owner.

(hereinafter referred to as 'BMW' and 'HD', respectively; and collectively referred to as the 'Complainants') filed complaints under Section 10 of the Ordinance read with Regulation 17 of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007 alleging that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using Complainants' registered trademarks on its products. It was further alleged that such use of Complainants' trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' and is prohibited in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance. The contents of the complaints are summarized as follows:
That BMW is a Company organized under and existing under the laws of Germany, having its registered office at Petuelring 130, BMW House, 80809 Munich, Germany. That BMW in the year 1917 developed the famous logo of BMW. The idea .of this logo was primarily based on the Circular Design of Aircraft propeller as well as the blue and white segments were reflective of the Bavarian coat of arms. 
That the goods sold and business conducted using trademark, service mark, company name and trade name BMW and BMW Logo throughout the world by BMW have been widely advertised in international magazines, periodicals and news papers which also have circulation in Pakistan and/or most have been seen by the Pakistani public and BMW has spent huge amount of money for this purpose which has resulted in the tremendous awareness of the trademark, trade name, service mark and company name of BMW and BMW Logo which are recognized by the traders and the general public throughout the world including Pakistan as originating and/or having association with BMW or under its authority.
That BMW has authorized Messrs Dewan Farooq Motors Limited, a Pakistani Company as authorized Importers/Dealers/Distributors for its BMW cars in Pakistan. .
That BMW, over a period of time, expanded its range of goods to other allied or related goods as well as large variety of fashion and luxury merchandise, accessories, etc., and in order to distinguish its goods, business and services from those of others, BMW either itself or through its subsidiaries, licensees and/or affiliates uses amongst other BMW as Trademark logo. Businesses and services include; cars, car accessories, automobile parts, motorcycles, bikes, mountain bikes, cruise bikes, kids bikes, bags and various other products such as golf kits, golf balls, golf sticks, wallets, key chains, fountain pens, ball points, umbrellas, locks, clothing, jackets, leather jackets, leather bags, jeans, caps, sport shirts, T-Shirts, cigarette cases and lighters etc.
That HD is an American motorcycle manufacturer. Founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the first decade of the 20th century, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great depression.
That HD also carries on, either itself or through its licensees, affiliates of associated companies, a wide range of manufacturing such as motorcycle, its parts and accessories and other wide range of products including but not limited to motorcycle clothing, motorcycle sports apparels including leather jackets, lifestyles accessories, which are marked using HD's trademarks.
There is no authorized dealer of HD in Pakistan and they have not authorized AGI to use their Trade Mark on its products.
 It has been alleged in the complaint that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using HD's registered trademarks on its products. It has been alleged that such use of HD's trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' in terms of Section 10 (2) (a), (b) & (c) of the Ordinance. HD has also appended the images from the website of AGI. (Annex-A and B to this Order).
 under different legal circumstances.","Upon receipt of the complaint, the Commission asked the Complainants' through its counsel, vide its letter dated 9-10-2009 to attend a meeting at the offices of the Commission in Islamabad on 14-10-2009 and to provide the following supporting documents/information within ten days of receipt of the letter:--
 
(i) A copy of authorization to act on behalf of the Complainants',
 
(ii) Certified copies of the Trade Mark Registration Certificates',
 
(iii) Whether any proceedings regarding the captioned matter between the Complainants and AGI have already been decided by any court of law or the Trade Mark Registry or by any other statutory body? If yes, then to provide the Commission with all pleadings and Orders passed thereon;
 
(iv) Whether the Complainants every authorized AGI to manufacture the leather jackets in the past for the Complainants?
 
(v) Details relating to the legal status of AGI;
 
(vi) When and how did it come to the Complainants' knowledge that AGI was allegedly using their trade mark? ;
 
(vii) What other forms of advertisement is AGI using besides advertising the jackets online for sale? ;
 
(viii) Whether the Complainants are aware of any sales made by AGI regarding the products advertised, bearing their trade mark? And to provide any sales receipts or purchase orders, if any, of those sales;
 
(ix) Whether the Complainants are also manufacturing and selling similar products themselves?
","Hence, keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am of the considered view that, deceptive marketing in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance has been carried out by AGI and the fraudulent use of the trademark by AGI was very much capable of harming the business interest of the complainants in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) and (d) of the Ordinance.
Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Ordinance, however, the approach of the representative of AGI needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and even amended their website immediately after receipt of letter from the Commission. In addition to the fact that he admitted the violation of the Ordinance not only at the enquiry stage but also during the course of hearing and cooperated by submitting all the record requisitioned by the Commission and apologizing and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit. I am, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 2,50,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, AGI is reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Ordinance.
In terms of what has been stated above both the Show Cause Notices Nos. 18 and 19 of 2010 issued to AGI are hereby disposed.
 

","The Complainant's counsel vide its letter dated December 21, 2009, provided the Commission with the fax numbers of AGI and also requested that substituted mode of service may please be adopted for serving the complaints to AGI.
The Complaints were again sent through fax and through courier vide letter dated 22-12-2009. This time the Complaints were received by the Respondent both through fax and through courier.
 
AGI vide its letters dated 6-1-2010 filed identical reply to both the Complaints, which reads as follows:
""That the Respondent is neither any incorporated concern nor a registered firm rather a small businessman under sole proprietorship. On initiation of business desirous to have some website and after having got prepared the same it was placed on web.
 
That the Respondent having no knowledge about such type of special laws innocently offered the garments from trade, with no intention to deceive any person in the universe in any manner whatsoever. However, if this hurt the Complainants, I am Sorry for the act and ready to amend the same and change the website accordingly rather has asked for it.""

The enquiry officers after analyzing and examining the Complaints and the above correspondence concluded the enquiry by producing the Enquiry Report dated 17-5-2010 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Enquiry Report""). The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""Though the conduct and attitude of the Respondent may appear to be innocent and ignorant of special laws such as the Ordinance, however, we are inclined with the legal principle that ignorance of law can be of no excuse. Therefore, in view of the above facts, annexures appended herewith, images of the website of the Respondent, and clear admission of the Respondent that, prima facie, there is a violation of Section 10(1) of the Ordinance and in particular clauses (a), (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance, on part of the Respondent.""
At the hearing on 17-6-2010, Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan submitted his analysis of the data provided by AGI and emphasized that the documents did not conform with the statements made at the previous hearing by the representatives of AGI. According to Mr. Khan AGI had a higher turnover than stated by Mr. Tayyab Ali at the first hearing. Mr. Tayyab Ali in response once again apologized and said that he has not lied to the Commission and has correctly stated the facts. He further added that in Sialkot several undertakings are engaged in such practices and they need to be educated through their chamber of commerce that they are in violation of the Ordinance. He filed the undertaking before the Commission admitting the violation of the Ordinance and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit.
Having gone through all the documents available on the record. The main issue which emerges in the matter is whether AGI has engaged itself into the deceptive marketing practices in violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance?
Since, AGI's admission, firstly at the enquiry stage vide its letter dated 6-1-2010 and subsequently vide its undertaking before me on 17-6-2010, leaves no doubt that they were using the trademarks of the Complainants on the images available on their website. During the hearing it was also admitted by AGI that, although they do not have the resources but advertising embellished details such as the capital, staff, tenure of the business always adds to the strength and popularity of the company amongst prospective customers and helps in fetching more orders from abroad. This admission in itself speaks volumes that, the proprietor of AGI although claims to be innocent and ignorant of law, is not that innocent at all. Further the allegations by the Complainant that their logos were used on the website by AGI knowingly that they are famous renowned logos owned by other companies, was never refuted by AGI and although not expressly admitted by the AGI but the statements made by them implies that the trademarks of Complainants' were used owing to their popularity amongst the public at large. The only justification which was afforded by the representatives of AGI was 'ignorance of law'.
During the course of hearing, I was informed by the representatives of AGI that as soon as AGI received letter from the Commission at the enquiry stage they removed all the images containing the registered logos of the complainant and have also amended their website. However, the counsel for the Complainant opposed this and submitted that on the following link the AGI's page showing the image of BMW jacket is still available.
I am least impressed with the justification afforded by AGI for violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance that, they were not aware that 'they were in breach and/or in contravention of any law'. It is pertinent to point out that 'ignorance of law is no excuse' is primarily based on the legal maxims Ignorantia juris non excusat which means ignorance of the law does not excuse or Ignorantia legis neminem excusat which means ignorance of the law excuses no one. The rationale behind these maxims is that if ignorance was an excuse, a person charged with criminal offence or a subject of a civil law suit would merely claim that he/she or it was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even though the person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law imputes knowledge of all laws to all persons within the jurisdiction no matter how transiently, especially to the laws which relates to the business which the person is involved in.
Furthermore, in the matter of Ahmad Bakhsh and 3 others v. Managing Director, (Superintending Engineer) WAPDA Electric Supply Company, Multan, 1995 PLC 536, it was held as follows:
""Nobody, could plead ignorance of provisions of Constitution or any other codified law, because after such law was notified in official Gazette; presumption would be that everybody living in country would have knowledge thereof'
Keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am inclined to hold that, plea of ignorance cannot be accepted as a valid justification or defence, at all. Moreover, the representative of AGI himself admitted that the information provided on the website regarding the establishment of AGI, its staff, its capital and ancillary details are only provided to build a good image and to fetch more orders from abroad, hence any plea of innocence does not seem tenable. In view of this clear intent and objective, it only makes the use of the subject trademarks as fraudulent on part of AGI.
With reference to the allegation that the unauthorized/fraudulent use of Complainant's registered trade marks by AGI is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant in terms of clause (a) subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance read with subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Ordinance.
The Complainants' counsel has submitted documents and copies of the certificate making it clear that the trademarks used by AGI on its website are exclusively owned by the Complainant and the documents available on the record also establish that the logos are well recognized and holds goodwill to themselves and are not only well known in the public at large but are also well recognized.
The documents and evidence available on the record such as the website images and the catalogues submitted by the Complainants establish that they are involved in the manufacturing and sale of the products, which AGI advertised on its website. There is no doubt that, the website of AGI is accessible from any where around the world and the products advertised and offered for sale on AGI's website are same as the ones manufactured and marketed by the Complainants, as well. In presence of the website images of AGI and their admission regarding unauthorized use of trade marks of the Complainant, there is no doubt in reaching to the conclusion that the information disseminated by AGI through its website is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainants with reference to the products advertised therein.

Versus
Messrs HAROON SWEET FACTORY and another---Respondents

","R.F.A. No. 108 of 2006, decided on 16th October, 2017.","13th July, 2017.","MUHAMMAD FARRUKH IRFAN KHAN, J.","The brief facts out of which this appeal has arisen are that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants/respondents from infringement of its Trade Mark Hilal Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant has been manufacturing and marketing sweets and candies bearing the said trade mark along with its label/wrapper in a particular colour scheme and design since 1988. It was also asserted that due to good quality, the sweets and candies of the appellant under this specific trade mark and label/wrapper have acquired great reputation and goodwill throughout the country. It was claimed that the said trademark along with its colour scheme and design was pending registration in class 30 under application No.1471128 and the copyrights in the said packaging of Hilal Khopra Candy Sweets is duly protected under the Trade Mark and Copy Rights Laws. Along with the suit the appellant attached certificate, regarding pendency of trademark registration application in class 30. The appellant alleged that by adopting a trademark Haroon Khopra Candy Sweets with identical packaging/label/wrapper, the respondents are not only infringing the appellant's trademark rights but also passing off their goods as the goods of the appellant and are thus continuously deceiving the appellant's customers besides causing financial loss to it.
The respondents defended the suit by filing their written statement and raised a preliminary objection that the suit was filed by an incompetent person. On merit it was pleaded that the appellant has merely filed a copy of the application for registration of the trademark which does not confer any exclusive right or cause of action in favour of the appellant; that it was at the most a suit for passing off which was to be filed before the Court of competent jurisdiction i.e. Civil Court and that the Court of District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the instant suit and adjudicate upon it. They refuted the plea of the appellant that Haroon Khopra Candy or its wrapper/label are similar or identical to Hilal Khopra Candy and its wrapper/label and submitted that as no exclusive right is vested in the appellant it cannot seek restraint against use of a label/wrapper having different colour scheme and design by the respondents under their trademark Haroon Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant had no cause of action. with an additional plaintiff.","1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for permanent injunction, against the defendants as prayed for? OPP
2. Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action to file the suit? OPD
3. Whether the suit for plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed in view of preliminary objection No.2? OPD
4. Whether the defendant is entitled to recover special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C. from the plaintiff? OPD
5. Relief.
","I hold that the colour scheme, design and getup of label/wrapper of respondent/defendant Ex-P-22 is deceptively and confusingly similar or nearly resemble the colour scheme, design and getup of the label/wrapper of Appellant/Plaintiff Ex-P-16 and is likely to cause confusion and deception to an unwary purchaser. Issue No. 2 is therefore, answered in favour of Appellant/Plaintiff and against the respondent/defendant. 
In view of my findings on issue No.1, it is held that appellant plaintiff has got a locus standi and a valid cause of action to file the suit. The findings of the learned Trial Court on this issue are over turned and it is decided in favour of the appellant/plaintiff against the respondent defendant.
These issues have already been decided in favour of the appellants. The findings of the learned Trial Court on these two issues are affirmed.
In view of my above findings the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2005 is set aside and suit of the appellant/plaintiff is decreed as prayed for with no order as to cost.
","From bare perusal of the wrappers/labels of both the parties it is to be noted that appellant's product packing Ex.P-16 comprises of dark blue label in which the dark blue shade becomes lighter going right side. The word Hilal is written in yellow on the left upper corner WHILE the label/wrapper of the respondent also has a dark blue, light blue, white, green and red colour scheme design and get up with only a few points of difference here and there as compared to that of the appellant's label/wrapper described above. 
PW-1 on behalf of the appellant deposed that defendants are marketing/selling 'Haroon Khopra Candy' sweets in a wrapper which is almost similar to that of the plaintiff's and as such they are deceiving the ordinary customers. On the other hand the respondent's witness DW-1 has deposed that the plaintiff has filed a false case against the defendant. He further stated that plaintiff's product is being sold by the name and style of 'Hilal Khopra Candy' whereas the name of defendant's product is 'Haroon Khopra Candy'; that the trademark of defendant's company is in the name of 'Haroon' while the name of plaintiff's trademark is 'Hilal'; that the defendant company is not copying the plaintiff's trademark. it can be concluded that these trademarks are identical. Moreover, it has come in the evidence of the defendant that Khopra is being sold by 30/35 companies in blue colour, as such it is concluded that even if plaintiff is prior user, even then it would not give right to the plaintiff to claim exclusive right in respect of' words Khopra Candy, hence it is concluded that the plaintiff was unable to prove issue.
The above findings of the learned Trial Court proceed on wrong premises. The Registration Certificate dated 20th November, 2014 of the plaintiff Ex.P-26 has not been taken into consideration in its true perspective. Only the disclaimer appearing on the Registration Certificate that appellant/plaintiff has no exclusive right in respect of Khopra Candy has been relied. Thus the Trial Court has erred in mixing the disclaimer on the word Khopra Candy with the rights that the appellant/plaintiff has claimed by virtue of the Registration of the features of the whole label i.e. colour scheme, design, get-up etc. In addition to this, the learned Trial Court has committed a further error by overlooking the established principle of law that for maintaining a passing off action registration of a trademark is not a requirement and even though there may be a disclaimer on any particular feature on a wrapper/label.
It has to be noted that under the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 a Mark has been defined by section 2(xxiv) as follows:-
""Mark includes, in particular a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name including personal name, signature, word, letter, numeral, figurative element, colour, sound or any combination thereof.""
Thus the law envisages each one of the above features namely, inter alia, a name, a word, figurative element, colour, etc., to be a mark by itself and goes on to further specify that any combination of these features would be a mark also. In the market place, generally for consumer products, it is usual for companies to market their products in attractive colourful labels/wrappers/packaging, which often carries a word, a figurative element, a particular colour scheme, design and get up. Each one of these features, as the definition of the 'Mark"" envisages, is a mark in itself. When one feature of a label consisting of a combination of marks is adopted or copied, infringement or copying of that feature (a mark) takes place which is liable to be remedied and it will not be a valid defence by a defendant that he has not adopted/imitated other features of the label mark, which may be different. Thus when a label comprising of a colour scheme, design and get up is copied/imitated by adopting a similar colour scheme, design and get up but with a different word, infringement to the extent of colour scheme design, and get up would take place and can be injuncted to that extent. Similarly if a word is copied but not the colour scheme, design and get up, the infringement takes place only to the extent of word mark and it will not be open to a defendant to allege that due to different word mark, or different colour scheme, design, get up, in the respective labels/packaging, there will be no likelihood of confusion or deception. This aspect has been explained/expounded in a number of reported cases, in a different context, by holding that when one or more of the essential features of a mark or a label is infringed, infringement takes place, for example, in the cases of ""Cecil De Cordova and others v. Vick Chemical Company"" (PLD 1951 Privy Council 108), Jamia Industries Ltd v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8), ""Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others"" (2001 SCMR 967) I would, therefore, hold that the plea that respondent's/defendant's mark is ""HAROON KHOPRA CANDY"" whereas Appellant's/Plaintiff's mark is ""HILAL KHOPRA CANDY"" and that the former's label/wrapper, colour scheme, design and get up, (Ex.P-22) which otherwise is confusing and nearly resembling to that of latter's label/wrapper colour Scheme, design and get-up (Ex.P-16) be considered to be different is not a legally sustainable defence and must be rejected.
Comparison by court between two marks not to be meticulous - Court to reach mind of an unwary purchaser - Question in cases of alleged conflict between two marks always being whether a person will be deceived when he sees one trade mark in absence of another mark.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and others---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28 of 2007, 6, 27, 81 of 2008 and 1 of 2009, decided on 25th July, 2018.","25th April, 2018.","KAUSAR SULTANA HUSSAIN, J.","Succinct the case of the appellant is that they filed applications before Registrar Trade Marks in accordance with the provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1940 and the Rules framed in pursuant to such Act, referred as Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963, such application were submitted prior to 12.04.2004 which is the date of coming into force of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, which was though promulgated on 14.04.2001, however in terms of section 1(3), the Ordinance had to take effect from a date to be notified in Official Gazette as reproduced below:-
(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 under unusual conditions.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

","Civil Appeal No.223-K of 2011, decided on 4th July, 2012.
(Against the judgment dated 29-12-2010 passed by High Court of Sindh, Karachi in M.A. No.55 of 2004).",,,"This Appeal impugns the Judgment of the learned High Court of Sindh (Karachi) in Miscellaneous Application No.55 of 2004 whereby the appeal filed by the respondent was allowed. Consequently the Order of the Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26-6-2004 dismissing the application of the respondent for registration of its trade mark i.e. ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" was set aside.
 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985. In 1991 an advertisement appeared in the Trade mark Journal for ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" for tea in respect of the respondent which was opposed by the appellant. The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
 under unusual conditions.","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

MESSRS SHAINAL AL-SYED FOODS FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:"," In the matter of
File No. 205/OFT/SHAINAL/CCP/2015, decided on 30th March, 2018.
",,,"The Complainant is a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 in Pakistan since 19 February 1970. It is engaged in the business of production, marketing and sale of a large variety (more than a hundred types) of food products at affordable prices, including but not limited to, dessert preparation mixtures, custards, jams, jellies, marmalades, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, sauces, recipe masalas, salts, snacks, spices and other ingredients (hereinafter the 'Complainant's Products').
4. The Complainant submitted that it has been using the word 'National' as a trademark, house mark and company name since 1970. Additionally it was stated that it has been using this registered trademark as a logo (copyright protected). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent started preparing, packing, marketing and selling imitated food products (hereinafter the ""Respondent's Products"") using a confusingly similar logo ""Shainal"" and packaging in terms of colour scheme, design and overall get up, to that of the Complainant's Products. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the following of its food products along with its product labelling and packaging were being imitated by the word National. 
With regard to the above allegations, an enquiry in terms of Section 37(2) of the Act was initiated by the Commission. The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""6.1 It appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, does amount to passing off its products as that of the Complainant's through fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and get up of products, in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) which prohibits fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging.
6.2 In view of the analysis, it also appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, has the potential to inflict harm upon the goodwill and business interest of the Complainant in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(a) and (b).
6.3 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large. 
Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Enquiry Report, the Commission approved the initiation of proceedings under Section 30 of the Act against the Respondent. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
""WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 in specific, it appears that the fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and getup of products by the Undertaking constitutes a prima facie violation of Section 10 (1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the fraudulent use of another's product labelling and packaging; and
WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.18 to 5.26 in specific, it appears that the Undertaking's conduct is not only capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant but also amounts to the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, which prima facie constitutes violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively;""

 with new evidence presented.","The issues for determination identified by the Commission are as follows:
A. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act through the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
B. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(b) of the Act through the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including information which lacks a reasonable basis, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
C. Whether, the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(a) through the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
","We note that during the enquiry as well as during the proceedings before the Commission the Respondent was given substantial time to amend/ revise its trade dress, however, no credible effort was made by the Respondent to change its trade dress and make it distinct from that of the Complainant. Hence, keeping in view the above, we are constrained to impose a penalty of PKR. 5,000,000/- (Rupees Five Million Only) on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
The Respondent is hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behaviour in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to cease and desist from the use of its Trade Dress (previous and revised submitted to the Commission) which is subject matter of this Order and similar to the Complainant's Trade Dress and Trade Mark, with immediate effect and not to use it in future. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's Trade Dress. The Respondent is also directed to file within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene any provision of the Act, in particular Section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondent shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of Section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
In terms of the above, SCN No. 34 /2016 is hereby disposed of.

","ISSUE A: 
According to Section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In simple terms, the mischief that Section 10 seeks to remedy is consumer deception. The Commission has established time and again that the term ""consumer"" is to be construed as the ordinary consumer for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act, reference in this regard is placed on 'in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zong reported as 2010 CLD 1478, wherein the Commission observed that 'restricting its interpretation with the use of the words `average', 'reasonable ' or 'prudent' will not only narrow down and put constraints on the effective implementation of the provision it would rather be contrary to the intent of law.
In its Order dated 8 February 2016 in the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. A Rahim Foods and reported as 2016 CLD 1128, the Commission expounded upon the concept of ""parasitic copying"" being an inherent part of the fraudulent use of another's product labeling and packaging. More specifically, the following explanation of parasitic copying demonstrates aptly the crucial aspects of the practice:
""Indeed parasitic copying typically consists in reproducing the main presentational features of market leading products (such as the shape of the product or of its packaging, color combination and graphic arrangement) but usually there is just enough difference to avoid a clear cut trade mark infringement.
Furthermore, the Commission is guided by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which contains provisions designed to tackle copycat packaging that misleads or confuses consumers. Article (1)(b) of the directive bans, commercial practices misleading consumers in relation to the main characteristics of the product, including its commercial origin. Article (2)(a), which is specifically dedicated to confusing marketing. Guided by the above general principles and adopting a holistic approach, the Commission's observations, on a juxtaposition of the images of the Complainant's Trade Dress and Respondent's Trade Dress are as follows:
i. There is no doubt that a pictorial comparison of the Complainant's Products and Respondent's Products leads to the obvious conclusion that there exist deceptively confusing similarities in the Complainant's Trade Dress and the Respondent's Trade Dress, almost to the extent of being identical but for the different brand names evident on the packaging.
As regards the allegation pertaining to the use of the name ""Shainal"" by the Respondent, it is observed that the same is a derivative of the brand name of two of the oldest market players, the Complainant i.e. ""National"" and ""Shan"". The name ""Shainal"" is a homophone of the brand name ""National"" in general and a combination of the words 'Shan' and National' in specific.
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of Section 10(1) in terms of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act to the extent of the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress.
ISSUE B: 
With respect to this issue, the Commission is required to determine whether the Respondent's copycat packaging of the Complainant's Trade Dress, also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to consumers within the scope of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.
Clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods; constitutes a deceptive marketing practice.
The terms ""misleading"" information has been interpreted by the Commission in the case reported as 2010 CLD 1478, as follows:
Misleading information: ""may essentially include oral or written statements or representations that are: (a) capable of giving wrong impression or idea, (b) likely to lead into error of conduct, thought or judgment, (c) tends to misinform or misguide owing to vagueness or any omission, (d) may or may not be deliberate or conscious, and (e) in contrast to false information, it has less erroneous connotation and is somewhat open to interpretation as the circumstances and conduct of a party may be treated as relevant to a certain extent"".
The Commission now considers the term 'reasonable basis' in light of section 10 of the Act. The concept of having a reasonable basis is an established doctrine in USA which was first recognised in the case of Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972).
In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the aforementioned conduct of the Respondent has resulted in a violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2) (b) of the Act, as the Respondent is disseminating misleading information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis, in the form of the confusing similarities of Respondent's Trade Dress to that of the Complainant's Trade Dress, thereby misleading the consumers as to the origin and place of production of the product.
ISSUE C: 
Clause (a) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information that it is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' shall be deemed to constitute a deceptive marketing practice.
This provision constitutes two main elements (i) the dissemination of false or misleading information (ii) that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking.
With reference to proving the actual harm caused to a competitors business interest, the Commission in its Order in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Jotun Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited reported as 2015 CLD 1638, stated that, actual harm to a competitors business interest need not be established to make out a violation in terms of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, the very presence of a deceptive market practice that has the potential to cause harm to the competitor's business is in fact sufficient to hold the Respondent culpable.
As per the ruling laid down by the Commission in the 2016 CLD 1128, ""in the event that there exists a contravention of Section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out"". Furthermore, as established above, copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, in itself also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to the public as it amounts to an unfair and deceptive trading practice. 
Based on the above, the Commission is of the considered opinion that, Respondent's practice of parasitic copying of the Complainant's Trade Dress, which appreciably impairs the consumer's ability to make an informed decision due to confusing similarities between the Respondent's Products and the Complainant's Products, being inherently deceptive, is in fact capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in contravention of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.",HBT/8/CCOP Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

M/S SHIELD CORPORATION LIMITED---Respondent
 

 
","High Court Appeal No. 244 of 2014, decided on 18th March, 2016.",,"ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.","Being aggrieved by the order dated 16 September, 2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.752 of 2014, disposing of the injunction application in favour of the present Respondent and restraining the Appellant from using the trade mark ""Shield and Device of Shield"", holding it identical and deceptively similar with the trade mark ""Health Shield plus Device of Shield"" of the Plaintiff, the instant appeal has been filed.
While the learned Single Judge has dealt the matter at length in the impugned order, snapshot of the controversy is that the Respondent who is a leading national entity engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling goods related to toothpaste, toothbrushes and baby care products since 1974 and, as claimed by his counsel and as per the copies of numerous trade mark registration certificates attached along with his counter, has obtained registration of the said trade mark, which acts as a house mark, in respect of all goods/services falling in Class-1 to Class 45 of the International Classification of Goods and Services under the Nice agreement (applicable in Pakistan also), notwithstanding that the business of the Respondent doesn't fall in more than a few classes of goods, in particular, class 3 for toothpaste, class 21 for toothbrushes, and class 10 for baby feeders and alike baby products.
On the other hand, the Appellant is a manufacturer and one of the most renowned vegetable ghee and cooking oil brand in the country taking the inception from pre-partition days and enjoys immense household reputation in relation to their goods i.e. Banaspati Ghee and Vegetable Oils, falling in Class 29. under heightened security.","To us, beside what has been settled in the above paragraph, the present controversy revolves around two basic elements:
(i) A trader while in the business of selected range of goods registers his trade mark in respect of all or a large number of classes of goods/services and uses the said instrument of registration certificate to restrain other traders from using a portion of his trade mark in respect of goods which the former has never manufactured and seeks to restrain the latter from using the portion of his trade mark in relation to goods which are of prime commercial interest to the latter; and
(ii) In what circumstances a trade mark can be held to be confusedly similar with another trade mark?
The answer to the second point is buried in piles of cases dating back centuries where courts have established the test of comparing two trade marks. These tests have been over and over used in numerous cases including those decided by courts in Pakistan. Briefly speaking the courts have come to the conclusion that while comparing as to deceptive similarity of two trade mark, the test known as Classic Trinity requires courts to consider following three aspects:
a. Goodwill of the trade mark of the plaintiff in respect of identical or similar goods;
b. Misrepresentation made by the Defendant; and
c. Actual damage caused to the Plaintiff from the acts of Defendant.","Thus, in the instant case, on account of the foregoing considerations, we come to the conclusion that the allegations of the Respondent are completely flawed on all the above discussed accounts, and the Appellant has legit reasons to continue to use its impugned trade mark. These are the reasons for the short order passed on 24.02.2016 allowing this appeal and dismissing the injunction application filed in the Suit No. 752/2014.","In order to give a face to the controversy, we find it prudent to reproduce the two contesting trade marks in the following:
Appellant's Trade Mark Respondent's Trade Mark
Also of relevance, is the manner in which these trade marks are used on their respective products; which we reproduce as under:
Appellant's Product Sample Respondent's Product Sample
There is a difference between the use of a mark (or sign) ordinarily and use of a mark as a trade mark. While a mark could be any graphical representation of a visually perceivable item on the packaging of a product (in the instant case), and the consumer connects it with the source of the goods. In other words when a mark (or sign) is used as a trade mark, it starts connecting products (or services) to their respective sources and origins and the customer uses the said mark when choosing a particular product, or when refusing another product instead. The manufacturer of Dalda cooking oil decides to remove the said Health Shield sign from its packaging, it will not affect distinctiveness of trade mark Dalda and the customer will always reach out and choose Dalda as their choice of product, in this example. This is the key difference between a mark (or sign) and a trade mark.
In the instant case, it is admitted that the Respondent has reputation and goodwill in its trade mark, however, such reputation and goodwill is only limited to the goods falling in Classes 3, 21 and 10, being toothbrushes, toothpastes, baby feeders and allied baby products. With regards, part 2, ""misrepresentation"" made by the Appellant, it can also be seen by looking at the complete packaging of the Appellant's product (as reproduced in paragraph 5), that no attempt has been made by the Appellant to misrepresent or disguise itself as the Respondent or to sail close to the Respondent. Applying the ""Moron In A Hurry"" test in the instant case, we tend to agree that even a moron in a hurry will not pick a bottle of Dalda cooking oil instead of Shield toothpaste, even if his last train is leaving for home in the next 5 minutes, on a Friday night.
With regards the third part of classic trinity, there is no iota in our mind that when products of both the parties are so different in nature, sold to different customer-needs, kept at different locations in shops (usually); a case of actual damage or loss to the Respondent on account of Appellant's use of the impugned trade mark could be imagined even. Therefore without taking any further time, we can safely conclude that the classic trinity test passes in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondent.
a trade mark is a badge of origin, the grant of a registration certificate is made to the person who uses (or honestly proposes to use) a trade mark in the course of trade to the benefit of customers so that the customers can distinguish the said trader's goods apart from other competitors' products. A trade mark registration certificate is thus a seal imposed by the Government certifying that goods manufactured (or sold) under the said trade mark will only and legitimately be sourced by the person in whose name the trade mark is registered. The concept of purity of trade mark register hinges to the idea that trade marks which are not used by their respective owners, shall be removed from the register of trade marks since possession of the registration certificate without active commercial use of the trade mark negates the very purpose of trade mark legislation.
By stretching beyond the umbrella provided, the legislation intends to mean that the person who has registered a trade mark is threatening infringement thereof when the defendant is (a) not using the identical trade mark; or (b) not in the course of trade; and (c) not using the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services. It could be thus seen that the act of the Appellant does not come anywhere inside the triangle created by these three pillars, therefore no infringement of the registered trade mark of the Respondent has been established.
As a last round, the counsel for the Respondent contended the act of the Appellant is causing ""dilution"" of the Respondent's trade mark. While, at the first hand, since the mark of the Respondent is allegedly registered in class 29, therefore a better claim (as already raised by it) ought to be of infringement, rather than of dilution. While there is no global list of well-known trade marks, but Coca-Cola; Google; Apple; McDonalds; Microsoft; IBM; Citibank; Boeing; Toyota are said to qualify such a list. With regards national trade marks, without prejudice, we are of the opinion, and such list could include trade marks like Mobilink, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, which on the basis of their immense reputation and goodwill, could be protected from unauthorized use on non-competing goods and services. Therefore to allege the 'dilution' claim, the Respondent has to prove the highest degree of fame required under section 86, to which in our opinion, trade mark of the Respondent SHIELD does not rise.

The sealing order issued by respondent No.2 was challenged before the learned Civil Judge, Peshawar, however, the same was returned to the petitioner under Order VII, Rule 10, C.P.C. for lack of jurisdiction.

No doubt under Article 18 of the Constitution, every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful trade or business, however, it does not allow unauthorized use of another's trade mark to capture consumer attention as using another's trade mark is much like posting a sign with another's trade mark in front of one's store just to confuse or deceive the buyer.
Since the petitioner has entered into agreement with Messrs 21C HTL for his business activities, therefore, petitioner is directed to remove all symbols/marks indicating or showing any resemblance or confusion with the monogram of Shell Pakistan Limited. Both the parties i.e. the petitioner and respondents Nos.5 and 6 have readily agreed to the conclusion arrived at by this Court. The petitioner may, however, approach a proper forum having jurisdiction for any other matter arising out of this civil revision as during the course of arguments no other issue except the one discussed above, has been raised by learned counsel for the petitioner.

File No. 205/OFT/SHAINAL/CCP/2015, decided on 30th March, 2018.
",,,"The Complainant is a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 in Pakistan since 19 February 1970. It is engaged in the business of production, marketing and sale of a large variety (more than a hundred types) of food products at affordable prices, including but not limited to, dessert preparation mixtures, custards, jams, jellies, marmalades, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, sauces, recipe masalas, salts, snacks, spices and other ingredients (hereinafter the 'Complainant's Products').
4. The Complainant submitted that it has been using the word 'National' as a trademark, house mark and company name since 1970. Additionally it was stated that it has been using this registered trademark as a logo (copyright protected). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent started preparing, packing, marketing and selling imitated food products (hereinafter the ""Respondent's Products"") using a confusingly similar logo ""Shainal"" and packaging in terms of colour scheme, design and overall get up, to that of the Complainant's Products. Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the following of its food products along with its product labelling and packaging were being imitated by the word National. 
With regard to the above allegations, an enquiry in terms of Section 37(2) of the Act was initiated by the Commission. The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""6.1 It appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, does amount to passing off its products as that of the Complainant's through fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and get up of products, in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) which prohibits fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging.
6.2 In view of the analysis, it also appears that the conduct of the Respondent, prima facie, has the potential to inflict harm upon the goodwill and business interest of the Complainant in violation of Section 10(1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(a) and (b).
6.3 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large. 
Based upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Enquiry Report, the Commission approved the initiation of proceedings under Section 30 of the Act against the Respondent. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
""WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 in specific, it appears that the fraudulent use of Complainant's logo, packaging, color scheme, design and getup of products by the Undertaking constitutes a prima facie violation of Section 10 (1) of the Act, in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the fraudulent use of another's product labelling and packaging; and
WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 5.18 to 5.26 in specific, it appears that the Undertaking's conduct is not only capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant but also amounts to the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, which prima facie constitutes violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively;""

 under heightened security.","The issues for determination identified by the Commission are as follows:
A. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act through the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act;
B. Whether the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(b) of the Act through the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including information which lacks a reasonable basis, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
C. Whether, the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning and scope of Section 10(2)(a) through the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, and hence a contravention of Section 10(1) of the Act.
","We note that during the enquiry as well as during the proceedings before the Commission the Respondent was given substantial time to amend/ revise its trade dress, however, no credible effort was made by the Respondent to change its trade dress and make it distinct from that of the Complainant. Hence, keeping in view the above, we are constrained to impose a penalty of PKR. 5,000,000/- (Rupees Five Million Only) on the Respondent, which shall be deposited with the Registrar of the Commission within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
The Respondent is hereby reprimanded to ensure responsible behaviour in future with respect to the marketing of their business and are directed to cease and desist from the use of its Trade Dress (previous and revised submitted to the Commission) which is subject matter of this Order and similar to the Complainant's Trade Dress and Trade Mark, with immediate effect and not to use it in future. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's Trade Dress. The Respondent is also directed to file within sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission reporting compliance with this Order, to ensure future compliance and not to contravene any provision of the Act, in particular Section 10 of the Act with respect to the subject matter.
In case the violation of this Order continues, it is then warranted that the Respondent shall be made further liable under subsection (3) of Section 38 of the Act to pay an additional penalty amounting to Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand Only) per day from the date of such violation.
In terms of the above, SCN No. 34 /2016 is hereby disposed of.

","ISSUE A: 
According to Section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In simple terms, the mischief that Section 10 seeks to remedy is consumer deception. The Commission has established time and again that the term ""consumer"" is to be construed as the ordinary consumer for the purposes of Section 10 of the Act, reference in this regard is placed on 'in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zong reported as 2010 CLD 1478, wherein the Commission observed that 'restricting its interpretation with the use of the words `average', 'reasonable ' or 'prudent' will not only narrow down and put constraints on the effective implementation of the provision it would rather be contrary to the intent of law.
In its Order dated 8 February 2016 in the matter of show cause notice issued to M/s. A Rahim Foods and reported as 2016 CLD 1128, the Commission expounded upon the concept of ""parasitic copying"" being an inherent part of the fraudulent use of another's product labeling and packaging. More specifically, the following explanation of parasitic copying demonstrates aptly the crucial aspects of the practice:
""Indeed parasitic copying typically consists in reproducing the main presentational features of market leading products (such as the shape of the product or of its packaging, color combination and graphic arrangement) but usually there is just enough difference to avoid a clear cut trade mark infringement.
Furthermore, the Commission is guided by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which contains provisions designed to tackle copycat packaging that misleads or confuses consumers. Article (1)(b) of the directive bans, commercial practices misleading consumers in relation to the main characteristics of the product, including its commercial origin. Article (2)(a), which is specifically dedicated to confusing marketing. Guided by the above general principles and adopting a holistic approach, the Commission's observations, on a juxtaposition of the images of the Complainant's Trade Dress and Respondent's Trade Dress are as follows:
i. There is no doubt that a pictorial comparison of the Complainant's Products and Respondent's Products leads to the obvious conclusion that there exist deceptively confusing similarities in the Complainant's Trade Dress and the Respondent's Trade Dress, almost to the extent of being identical but for the different brand names evident on the packaging.
As regards the allegation pertaining to the use of the name ""Shainal"" by the Respondent, it is observed that the same is a derivative of the brand name of two of the oldest market players, the Complainant i.e. ""National"" and ""Shan"". The name ""Shainal"" is a homophone of the brand name ""National"" in general and a combination of the words 'Shan' and National' in specific.
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of Section 10(1) in terms of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act to the extent of the fraudulent use of the Complainant's Trade Dress.
ISSUE B: 
With respect to this issue, the Commission is required to determine whether the Respondent's copycat packaging of the Complainant's Trade Dress, also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to consumers within the scope of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.
Clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods; constitutes a deceptive marketing practice.
The terms ""misleading"" information has been interpreted by the Commission in the case reported as 2010 CLD 1478, as follows:
Misleading information: ""may essentially include oral or written statements or representations that are: (a) capable of giving wrong impression or idea, (b) likely to lead into error of conduct, thought or judgment, (c) tends to misinform or misguide owing to vagueness or any omission, (d) may or may not be deliberate or conscious, and (e) in contrast to false information, it has less erroneous connotation and is somewhat open to interpretation as the circumstances and conduct of a party may be treated as relevant to a certain extent"".
The Commission now considers the term 'reasonable basis' in light of section 10 of the Act. The concept of having a reasonable basis is an established doctrine in USA which was first recognised in the case of Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972).
In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the aforementioned conduct of the Respondent has resulted in a violation of Section 10(1) read with Section 10(2) (b) of the Act, as the Respondent is disseminating misleading information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis, in the form of the confusing similarities of Respondent's Trade Dress to that of the Complainant's Trade Dress, thereby misleading the consumers as to the origin and place of production of the product.
ISSUE C: 
Clause (a) of Section 10 of the Act provides that 'the distribution of false or misleading information that it is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' shall be deemed to constitute a deceptive marketing practice.
This provision constitutes two main elements (i) the dissemination of false or misleading information (ii) that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking.
With reference to proving the actual harm caused to a competitors business interest, the Commission in its Order in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Jotun Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited reported as 2015 CLD 1638, stated that, actual harm to a competitors business interest need not be established to make out a violation in terms of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, the very presence of a deceptive market practice that has the potential to cause harm to the competitor's business is in fact sufficient to hold the Respondent culpable.
As per the ruling laid down by the Commission in the 2016 CLD 1128, ""in the event that there exists a contravention of Section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out"". Furthermore, as established above, copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of clause (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act, in itself also amounts to the dissemination of misleading information to the public as it amounts to an unfair and deceptive trading practice. 
Based on the above, the Commission is of the considered opinion that, Respondent's practice of parasitic copying of the Complainant's Trade Dress, which appreciably impairs the consumer's ability to make an informed decision due to confusing similarities between the Respondent's Products and the Complainant's Products, being inherently deceptive, is in fact capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in contravention of clause (a) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act.",HBT/8/CCOP Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

","F. No. 279/PC HOTELS/OFT/CCP/2017, decided on 19th November, 2018.","30th August, 2018.",nil,"the Competition Commission of Pakistan (the 'Commission') vide the Show Cause Notice (the 'SCN') dated 10th July 2018 issued to Messrs Omni Comm (Pvt.) Limited (the 'Respondent') notified that there exists a prima facie case of contravention of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2), section 10(2)(a) and section 10(2)(b) of the Act and called upon to show cause in writing within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt of the SCN and also to appear and place before the Commission the facts and material in support of its contentions either in person or through an authorized representative on 7th August 2018 at the office of the Commission and to explain why an appropriate order under section 31 of the Act may not be passed and/or a penalty for the aforesaid violation may not be imposed under section 38 of the Act.
3. On 16th August 2018, at the first hearing the representative of the Respondent requested for an adjournment as their Counsel was not feeling well and they also presented copy of the order by honourable Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench, Peshawar, in Writ Petition No. 923-A/2018 dated 15th August 2018, restraining the Commission from passing final order in the instant matter, but can proceed with the Show Cause notice. However, no one was present on behalf of Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.) Ltd despite service of notice and intimation by the Registrar of the Commission, therefore, the Bench proceeded ex parte against Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.) Limited in pursuance of proviso to clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 30 read with clause (e) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 26 of the GER. under unusual conditions.",nil,"After hearing the Parties at length and considering the assistance rendered by the Director General (Legal), we are of the view that the Act was promulgated with the scope to provide free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti -competitive behaviors, which inter alia include deceptive marketing practices prohibited under section 10 of the Act. Till the issuance of the final Order and conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act under the SCN, the Respondent and Messrs Lucky Gold (Pvt.) Limited are directed to refrain from using the trademarks of the Complainant i.e. ""PC"" or ""Pearl Continental""; and
(b) The Respondent is directed not to claim any association or affiliation with the Complainant during the course of its business activities, till the conclusion of the proceedings under section 30 of the Act and until further Orders.
18. The Respondent is directed to file the compliance report with reference to the directions given in Para 19 above within seven (7) days from the date of this Order with the Registrar of the Commission, without fail.
Needless to say, the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and without prejudice to further proceedings in the instant proceedings.
20. In terms of the above, the IO Application stands allowed and the Registrar of the Commission is directed to transmit copies of this Order to the concerned parties.
","The Complainant has prayed that the Commission may pass an interim order under section 32 of the Act requiring the Respondents to refrain from displaying the unauthorized/unlicensed use of Complainant's registered mark and logo ""PC""-""Pearl Continental"" or ""PC"" at its premises in contravention of the provisions of the Act including but not limited to recovering any all display boards with the logo ""PC"" and remove the letters ""PC"" from all key chains, hotel menu cards, letter heads, cards and other materials meant for dissemination to customers in line with Section 10. And grant such other relief as may be deemed fit and proper in the circumstances to prevent further irreparable loss and damage to the business and goodwill of the Complainant till the conclusion of the proceedings in the subject complaint.
The Complaints highlight the fact that Respondents are unresponsive to the SCN violating the law and undermining the writ of the Commission. As the Order will take its due course and considerable time. Hence, to prevent the ongoing infringements and deceptive marketing practices the Commission must restrain the Respondents.
c) Continued deceptive marketing practices would cause serious harm to the Complaints as well as the consumers. It is in public interest to stop the unlicensed/unauthorized use of Complainants registered tradename.

","High Court Appeal No. 170 of 2003, decided on 18th May, 2004.",,,"Through these proceedings, the appellants have impugned order dated 23-5-2004 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.677 of 2001, filed by the respondent, allowing the injunction application of the respondent observing therein that the respondent in terms of section 21 of the Trade Marks Act have right to use the Trade Mark which is subject-matter of this appeal, to the exclusion of the appellants.
The facts, as it appear from the pleadings of the parties are that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court for infringement of trade mark, passing off, perpetual injunction, rendition of accounts and damages against the appellants. Alongwith the suit, the respondent made an application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. praying therein that the appellants be restrained from infringing the alleged trade mark and from passing off the goods. It appears that the matter was contested by the parties before the learned Single Judge who by his order, impugned in these proceedings, had allowed the application of the respondent restraining the appellants from infringing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, supplying, distributing or otherwise passing off the goods under the alleged trade mark `ALETRIS CORDIAL'.
 with new technological evidence.","Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the impugned order is bad in law and has failed to take notices' of the facts in its true perspective. He has further argued that the respondent had no prima facie case and were not entitled to the grant of injunction. According to the learned counsel once title in question of the trademark of a party was in dispute, the Court would riot grant injunction in favour of such a party. 
As against this, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge.","We fully endorse the findings of the Honourable Single Judge given in the impugned order while granting injunction. This Appeal is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs. However, office is directed to fix Suit No.677 of 2001 for settlement of issues within fifteen days and after the issues are settled the matter be listed for evidence, out of turn within 3 months after framing of issues.
 

 
","From the pleadings of the parties it appears that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court against the appellants claiming to be a Private Limited Company doing its business of medicines since 1948. In the plaint, the respondent has pleaded that besides the other, medicines of various brands, which the respondent was manufacturing and selling, the respondent claims to be registered proprietor of trade mark ""ALTERIS CORDIAL'. The respondent subsequently applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks to enter its name in the Register of Trade mark as subsequent proprietor of the said trade mark, which application was allowed and the respondent became subsequent proprietor of the trade mark. According to the respondent the homeopathic medicine by the name of `ALETRIS CORDIAL' under the said trade mark on the device of the bottle in the hand, with distinctive, get up, design and yellow and black colour scheme, due to its high quality gained popularity and was in great demand and, therefore, the respondent got valuable reputation and goodwill in respect of the said medicine in the market.
 
In the year 1998 the respondent came to know that the appellant No. 1 had applied and got registered the label of the respondent said registered trademark in the office of Registrar of Copyright as artistic copyright work label created by him. The respondent made an application for rectification under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, before the Board which application was allowed against which the appellants preferred an appeal which appeal is pending in the Lahore High Court. According to the respondent the appellant No. 1 is manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale his spurious medicine in the trade mark registered in the name of the respondent with the same colour, scheme, get up, design and style. The respondent has disputed the ownership of the Trade mark of the appellant No.1. The appellants in rebuttal filed Counter-Affidavit and Written Statement. It appears that the Honourable Single Judge heard the matter at length and thereafter has passed the impugned order with detail reasons.
 
The impugned order has been passed on an interlocutory application and the learned counsel for the appellants had argued that the grant of injunction when the damages were also claimed, ex-facie was erroneous order. If such an argument is accepted, the usurping of goodwill of the trade mark by the appellants who, prima facie, have no right under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, would be unjust as has been held in the case of TAPAL Tea (Private) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Company reported in 2002 CLD 1113. Pendency of proceedings in appeal preferred by the appellants against the order of the Board, is hardly a ground restricting the Court from granting injunction if a party was otherwise, entitled to such an injunction. Even otherwise, a person, prima facie, having no legal right, guaranteed in law, could not be allowed to continue his business in the face of the reasons advanced by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order. The impugned order has been passed on the material placed before the Honourable Single Judge and we find no reason to upset it. However, the appellants are at liberty to lead evidence to establish their legal right to do the business. The Honourable Single Judge has already observed in the impugned order that his findings were tentative in nature and is subject to evidence, which the parties may lead in support of their pleas. Even observations in the impugned order were held to be tentative and would not prejudice either party before the Registrar, Trade marks or before any forum.",S.A.K./R-11/K Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

Messrs A. RAHIM FOODS (PRIVATE) LIMITED FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES: In the matter of

 
","Show Cause Notice No. 1 dated 3rd April, 2014, decided on 8th February, 2016.",,,"The Complainant is engaged in the poultry business, and also in the processing, marketing and sales of frozen and processed meat products. The Respondent is a part of the Dawn Foods group of companies, (the 'Dawn Group'), and is engaged in the business of manufacturing, processing, marketing and sales of a large variety of food and frozen food products.
The Complainant alleged that the Respondent had copied its distinctive and instantly identifiable labelling and packaging which it developed for its frozen and/or processed meat products, thereby causing deception which has the effect of misleading and confusing consumers, while taking undue advantage of the market standing and goodwill of its products.
With regard to the above, a formal enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 12 December 2013, (the 'Enquiry Report')1. Based on the prima facie findings of the Enquiry Report, a SCN was issued to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before the Commission. The relevant portions of the SCN are reproduced below:
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 4.23 in particular, it appears that:
(a) By using the exact language, font and color scheme of the Complainant's packaging material of frozen, processed, ready to cook and fully cooked chicken and meat products on its own frozen food product's packaging by the Undertaking is misleading and deceptive and is prima facie violation of the provisions of section 10 of the Act, in particular section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
(b) The use of mark 'COMBO WINGS"" by the Undertaking without seeking authorization from the Complainant being a trademark owner, is misleading, deceptive and fraudulent and in prima facie violation of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act, in particular, section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
(c) The use of exact language, font and color scheme of the Complainant's packaging material of frozen, processed, ready to cook and fully cooked chicken and meat products on its own frozen food product's packaging and the use of mark 'COMBO WINGS' by the Undertaking without any authorization is misleading and deceptive and appears to be capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in prima facie violation of the provisions of section 10 of the Act, in particular section 10(2)(a) of the Act.
 under different legal circumstances.","The issues identified by the Commission are therefore as follows:
 
A. Whether the Respondent's product labelling and packaging is misleadingly similar to that of the Complainant's K&N Packaging and if so, whether such confusing resemblance is deceptive and amounts to the ""fraudulent use of another's....... product labelling or packaging"" within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act;
 
B. Whether the use of the term/mark 'Combo Wings' by the Respondent, in the absence of authorization from the Complainant, amounts to the ""fraudulent use of another's trademark..."" within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(d) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act;
 
C. Whether, the Respondent's product labelling and packaging and/or use of the mark 'Combo Wings' amount to the ""distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests"" of the Complainant within the meaning and scope of section 10(2)(a) and hence a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act.
 
","In view of the Respondent's violations of section 10 of the Act, the Commission hereby imposes on it a penalty of:
 
i. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act; 
ii. Pakistani Rupees 10 Million (PKR 10,000,000) for the contravention of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act;
The Respondent is therefore liable to pay a sum of Pakistani Rupees 20 Million (PKR 20,000,000).
The Commission further directs the Respondent to cease use of the contentious copycat packaging for its frozen and/or processed meat product within one month. The Respondent is directed to ensure that the products are repackaged in a manner that is distinct in its overall layout, design, shape, size, language and colour scheme so as to be easily distinguishable from the Complainant's products.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar of the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order.
In terms of the above, SCN No.1/2014 is hereby disposed of.
","The factual and legal analysis herein below shall be structured according to the sequence and order of the three pertinent issues demarcated above as Issue A, B and C.
ISSUE A:
12. Section 10(2)(d) of the Act provides that 'fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name, or product labelling or packaging' 'constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. In its Order in the Matter Of Complaint Filed By M/s. DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (the 'DHL Order'), the Commission with regards to the interpretation of the term 'fraudulent' stated that 'while interpreting section 10 of the Act; one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trade mark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. Rather than making it too complex by focusing on subjective ""intentions"" of the Respondents, in our considered view, it is best if we adopt simplistic approach i.e. if it can be demonstrated that the Respondents by use of the trade mark, intended to deceive the customer/consumer to gain an advantage. Keeping in view the nature of contravention, it is not the subjective intent but the objective manifestation of that intent that will establish the fraudulent use'. 
We find it useful to consider the issue of 'parasitic copying' as raised by the Complainant and discussed in the Enquiry Report. According to the definition quoted in the Enquiry Report, 'parasitic copying' or 'copycat' packaging' 'is the practice of designing the packaging of a product in a way that gives it the general look and feel of a competing, well-known brand (typically the market leader). In cases of both parasitic copying and a contravention of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act, there exists an element of wilful deceitfulness along with free-riding and passing off.
The Respondent's argument regarding a correlation between the colour red and hunger is found to be one-dimensional and unconvincing. While a psychological connection between appetite and colours may or may not exist, the Commission considers that unless a specific colour was denoted as a standardized requirement to be followed by all food processing and packaging companies, or even inherently related to the properties or functions of a product, its copying in the presence of a market leader already using it would require a more compelling justification.
In order to provide further factual clarity, it is the Commission's view that the only real and meaningful distinguishing factor between the K&N Packaging and that of the Respondent's, is the existence of the parties respective trademarked logos i.e. ""K&N's"" and ""Dawn Foods"" on the front side of the product packaging. If such logos were hypothetically to be hidden or removed, it would in fact be visually impossible to identify and distinguish the origin of the products as belonging to which of the two competitors. The Commission's concern of mimicry and confusing similarity is further heightened by the fact that both parties' products, being of the same nature, are predominantly displayed for sale side by side, adjacent to each other in large common freezers located at retail stores, supermarkets and other points of sale across the country. 
Therefore, in relation to Issue A and in view of the above legal and factual analysis, the Commission is fortified in its decision as to the existence of a contravention by the Respondent of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act.
 
ISUUE B: 
It is observed that the Enquiry Report at paragraph 4.20 states that the term ""Combo Wings"" is generic, and part of common usage. The SCN however has erroneously referred to the term as the Complainant's distinctive trademark based on the averments by the Complainant in its Complaint. The Complainant did not, at the time of lodging its Complaint with the Commission, own any trademark rights in the said term. As per the documents on the record, while the Complainant had in fact filed an application for the registration of a trademark in the name and style of ""Combo Wings"" with the Trade Marks Registry, Intellectual Property Organization, the process of advertisement and objections before acceptance of the same remained pending at the time of receipt of the Complaint by the Commission. The Complainant has incorrectly stated on record that the Registrar of Trademarks had ""accepted and approved"" the trademark in question.
Therefore, in this regard, the Commission concludes that, notwithstanding the Complainant's use of the mark ""Combo Wings"" on its K&N Packaging prior in time to the adoption of the same by Respondent, there has been no contravention by the Respondent of section 10(1) in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act pertaining to the specific issue of alleged fraudulent use of another's ""trademark"". The trademark claimed to have been used without authorization must be registered with the competent authority for the Commission to proceed under this provision of the Act.
ISSUE 3:
A commercial practice is automatically considered as misleading if such marketing practice (including promoting and packaging of a product) causes confusion for the consumers in comparison to another product of a competitor and hence influences their transactional choice. Similarly, in terms of the Act, in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(2)(d) by an undertaking, a concurrent violation of section 10(2)(a) is also made out. Furthermore, parasitic copycat packaging, being a practice that falls within the ambit of section 10(2)(d) and one which causes deceptive confusion for the consumer, in itself also amounts to the dissemination or distribution of misleading information to the public.
It is also pertinent to clarify here that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than section 10(2)(d) of the Act. While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section 10(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise.
The Commission further finds that the Respondent's use of the unregistered and non exclusive mark ""Combo Wings"" is an act which, when viewed in isolation, does not attract the provision of section 10(2)(a) of the Act and hence does not amount to the distribution of misleading information capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant. However, the Commission concludes as it did with regards to Issue B, that such use of the said mark in conjunction with the copied packaging and product labelling as a whole, is in fact misleading and capable of causing harm to the Complainant. Lastly, the Commission, before dealing with the penalties that are attracted in the instant matter, would like to make it abundantly clear that in reaching its decision as to the violations committed by the Respondent, it has in no way attempted to restrain or deny the Respondent its right to free trade in the relevant market. The Commission has reached its decision based solely on deceptive and misleading similarities in the products of the two parties concerned, which have arisen due to the indulgence by the Respondent in ""deceptive marking practices"" as prohibited by section 10 of the Act.

The REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and others---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeals Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28 of 2007, 6, 27, 81 of 2008 and 1 of 2009, decided on 25th July, 2018.","25th April, 2018.","KAUSAR SULTANA HUSSAIN, J.","Succinct the case of the appellant is that they filed applications before Registrar Trade Marks in accordance with the provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1940 and the Rules framed in pursuant to such Act, referred as Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963, such application were submitted prior to 12.04.2004 which is the date of coming into force of Trade Marks Ordinance 2001, which was though promulgated on 14.04.2001, however in terms of section 1(3), the Ordinance had to take effect from a date to be notified in Official Gazette as reproduced below:-
(1) SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT.
(i) This Ordinance may be called the Trade Marks Ordnance, 2001.
(ii) It extends to the whole of Pakistan.
(iii) This section and section 132 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall come into force on such date as the Federal Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
 under unusual conditions.","I have heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of appellants as well as Respondents and also considered material available in case files. The main controversy is that whether Trade Marks Rules, 2004 are applicable or Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 shall apply to pending applications filed for Registration of Trade Marks under the ""Old Law"" and/or advertised in ""Trade Marks Journal"" published after coming into effect of New Rules 2004.","Accordingly appeals in hand are disposed of in the above terms. Consequently impugned order is set aside with decision that case which fall within the ambit of Article 10 of fourth schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 shall be dealt with under Trade Marks Act, 1940 as provided in the said Ordinance and process and procedure shall be adopted as provided in Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
I take this opportunity to commend learned counsel who brilliantly advanced their respective arguments.
",". Section 133 of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2004 envisage the ""Transition Mechanism"" which is re-produced as under:-
133. TRANSITIONAL. The provisions of the Fourth Schedule shall have effect with respect to transitional matters, including the treatment of trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 (V of 1940), and applications for registration and other proceedings pending under that Act, on the commencement of this Ordinance.
Article 10(1) of the fourth Schedule is also reproduced for ready reference.
From bare reading of substance of section 133, it transpires that the said section read with Article 10 of fourth schedule provide a mechanism, whereby transitional matters are to be governed. Article 10(1) of fourth schedule stipulates that an application for registration of a mark under ""Old Law"" which advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso of that subsection or order has been made for its advertisement before the commencement of new law shall be dealt with under the Old Law. The word ""Shall"" signifies that in the matter of applications referred to above, the applicant has no discretion and the application so made have to follow ""old law"".
9. However Article 11 of fourth schedule specifically deals with the conversion of pending application for registration which have not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15 or the proviso to that subsection neither an order has been made for such advertisement before the commencement of new law. For ready reference, Article 11 of fourth schedule of ""new law"" and relevant entry in second schedule of Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is reproduced below:-
CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION ARTICLE 11.
(1) In the case of pending application for registration which has not been advertised under subsection (1) of section 15, or the proviso to that subsection of the 1940 Act, neither an order has been made for such advertisement being the commencement of this Ordinance, the applicant may give notice to the Registrar claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) The notice under sub-para (1) shall be in the prescribed form, be accompanied by the appropriate fee and be given not later than twelve months after the commencement of this Ordinance.
(3) The notice under sub-para (1), duly given shall be irrevocable and have the effect that the application shall be treated as if made immediately after the commencement of this Ordinance.
Now I will dilate upon Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules 2004, Sub-Rule (2) whereof is the basis of the decision of learned Registrar. Conversely appellants also put their much emphasizes on the interpretation of said Rule. Rule 134 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2004 is re-produced below for ready reference:-
134. FORM FOR CONVERSION OF PENDING APPLICATION.
(i) A notice to the Registrar under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance; claiming to have the registerability of the mark determined in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance, shall be in the form as set out in Form TM-44.
(ii) Where an application for registration of trade mark made under the old law is advertised on or after these rules comes into force, the period within which notice of opposition may be filed shall be governed under these rules and not under rules hereby repealed.
11. In my humble view, headings in a statute or Rule may be taken into account to ascertain true sense and correct meaning of the provisions contained thereunder when they appear self-conflicting or ambiguous. Increased clarity in such cases may also be construed when every provision under a specific heading or sub-heading as the case may be, is read in conjunction with such heading or sub-heading. In Legal Dictionary the word ""heading"" is defined as a ""words prefaced to the start of sections of Acts of Parliament. These may be utilized in statutory interpretation"".
In the instant case it is apparent that heading is given to whole section comprising of two subsections, if the intention of Rule making authority would have otherwise, Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 134 may have given separate Section number or separate Heading. 
From above discussion, it is evident that ""Old Law"" i.e. Trade Marks Act, 1940 also include the ""Rules repealed"" viz Revised Trade Mark Rules, 1963. Further more from Article 1(c) of the fourth schedule of Ordinance 2001, Rule 1(c) of Trade Mark Rules 2004 and section 3(37b) of General Clauses Act 1897, an inference can be drawn that ""Old Law' includes the ""old rules"" viz Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963.
It is also the General principle of natural justice that a person cannot be devoid of his due legal right accrued to him during the currency of a particular legal instrument and thereby he cannot be subject to a lesser beneficial treatment, departure to this principle is thus an exception.
16. In the present case it is construed that four applications fall within the ambit of Article 10 of Fourth Schedule, the Trade Mark Ordinance, 2001 is not applied retrospectively as evident from the applicability of ""old law"" in such cases; however applications falling in the category specified in Article 11 of the Fourth Schedule, it is applied retrospectively and a mechanism was provided for conversion of pending applications to ""new law"" to make them in conformity with the same. It is also a settled principle of interpretation that statute is to be read as a whole, every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the enactment
In the instant case it can be construed that ""scheme of law"" includes enactment and statutory Instruments. In the instant case such set of ""scheme of law"" includes Trade Marks Act, 1940 to be applied in conjunction with Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963 and the other such set encompasses Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 along with Trade Marks Rules, 2004 commencement date of both is 12.04.2004.
18. In view of above discussion, I am of the view that impugned order passed by the learned Registrar is against the sprit of provisions contained in Article 10 of Fourth Schedule of Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 read with Rule 135 and Rule 2(c) of Trade Marks Rules, 2004 and also not in conformity with the provision of section 6(c) read with section 3, subsection (37b) of General Clauses Act, 1897. The interpretation of Rule 134(2) of Trade Marks Rues in isolation without considering the scheme of law and Heading of Rule 134 is also in contravention of General Principles of Interpretation of statutes.

Messrs SHAUKAT SOAP AND GHEE INDUSTRIES (PVT.) LTD.---Appellant
 
Versus
 
Messrs SHAUKAT BROTHERS SOAP MANUFACTURERS (PVT.) LTD.---Respondent

"," 
F.A.O. No. 157 of 2015, decided on 27th May, 2015.",,,"This appeal under section 104 of the C.P.C. has been filed by Messrs Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") through its Chief Executive Mr. Habib Ahmad against the order dated 19.2.2015, passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala in Civil Suit No.2 of 2012 whereby application of the appellant filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction against Messrs Shaukat Brothers Soap Manufacturers (Pvt.) Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as ""the respondent"") has been dismissed.
The background of the case is that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction against the respondent. Along with the suit it filed an application for temporary injunction. In the suit it was averred that the appellant's Trade Mark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" is registered under Registration Nos.25850 dated 30.6.1956 and 44332 (in Class 3) dated 8.11.1965 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Trade Mark""). The said Trade Mark registrations were originally obtained in the name of Abdul Ghani, Abdul Hamid, Manzoor Ahmed, Muhammad Siddique, Mushtaq Ahmed trading as Shaukat Soap Factory, Thanewala Bazar, Gujranwala. According to the extract of the certified copy of the registration No.44332, pursuant to a request for change of ownership on Form No. TM-24, on 15th August, 1979 Messrs Shaukat Soap Factory Ltd. having the same address was registered as the subsequent proprietor of the Trademark w.e.f. 9.8.1972. Based on the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company filed along with the suit it has been submitted that the company incorporated in the name of Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., the appellant, has taken over the running business and concern carried out at Gujranwala in the name and style of Shaukat Soap Factory; that this subsequent merger is being recorded with the Trademarks Registry and the appellant claims that it is the true and bona fide owner of the aforesaid Trademark and that it has the exclusive right under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 to use or authorize the use of the aforesaid Trademark.
The respondent on the other hand contested the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction by contending that the Trademark Registration Nos.25850 and 44332 for the registration of the words ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" are invalid as these words cannot be considered to be of a distinctive character under section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 and that the word ""SHAUKAT"" is a surname according to its ordinary significance; that the said word cannot be registered as a Trademark as it is free to be used by anyone who has the name Shaukat. The respondent further asserted that the Trademark ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" is a distinctive Trademark and sufficiently different from the Trademark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" so there is no possibility of any confusion or deception in the market.
At the time of the decision of the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. the above said factual background and information/material was available with the learned Additional District Judge. However, in her impugned judgment she has proceeded to decide the matter on the ground that there is very minor similarity between the trademarks ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" and ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" as there is only a common usage of colour yellow by the respondents similar to those of the appellant on their wrapper in which the soap is packed. She has relied on the case law reported as Messrs Super Asia v. Anwar Industries (2007 CLD 1181) stating that it has been held in the said case that the trademark ""Asia"" and ""Super Asia"" were held to be different names and not confusingly similar. Lastly she has observed that both the parties are real brothers and since they have inherited the business, as such they have similar rights and claims on the basis of which it has been held in the impugned judgment that the appellant has failed to establish a good prima facie arguable case and, therefore, observed that there was no need to discuss other ingredients for the grant of temporary injunction with new technological evidence.","The stance of learned counsel for the respondent that the trademark ""SHAUKAT"" is hit by section 6(1)(d) of the Trademarks Act, 1940 (which is similar in scope as section 14 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) as such it was not registerable and thus a prima facie case is not made out in favour of the appellant, is not sustainable for the reason that section 43 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark the fact that a person is registered as a proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trademark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof, whereas section 44 ibid provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark, the original registration of the trademark shall, after five years from the date of its original registration, be taken to be valid in all respects unless the registration was obtained by fraud or unless it offends the provisions of section 14(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. 
A Court dealing with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. has to consider which of the parties has a prima facie case, balance of convenience or inconvenience and likely to suffer irreparable loss in case of grant or refusal of interim injunction.
The respondent has adopted SHAUKAT and has added the word CRYSTAL before it. Therefore, in essence the question is whether addition of a word to a registered trademark, and in this case which has been used for a long time, makes the two marks sufficiently different based on which there is no possibility of confusion or deception.
","In the circumstances, the impugned order is set-aside and the respondent is restrained from using the word ""SHAUKAT"" as a trademark either alone or along with the word ""CRYSTAL"" or in conjunction with any other word or device along with a wrapper of soap which is yellow and black in colour scheme, design and get up and depicts the portrait of their predecessor in the same place and position as that of the appellant till the decision of the main suit. It is, however, pointed out that no observation made by this Court in this order would be taken into account while deciding the main suit which would be decided on the basis of evidence recorded and the arguments of the parties at the relevant time. The instant appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms.
","During the course of arguments learned counsel for the respondent has failed to answer the query of this Court as to whether or not the claim of the respondent relates to a disputed business built around trademark SHAUKAT SOAP which they were also claiming through common usage or inheritance.
The law provides a proper mechanism and procedure for seeking revocation (section 73) and invalidity of registration (section 80) to an aggrieved party for redressal of its grievance, if it considers that a trademark in dispute was wrongfully registered by its proprietor. No such application/petition appears to have been filed by the respondent before the Court/Forum of Competent Jurisdiction. In the absence of filing of any such formal application, the argument of respondent to that effect cannot be considered. Also unless any act of fraud is prima facie floating on the surface of a trademark registration, the trademark registration, which is obtained after thorough examination and publication of notice in the Trademarks Journal for inviting public objections, must be considered to be validly registered and be enforced to provide certainty to its owner for protection of its registered rights.
The appellant company has exclusive right, reputation and good will therein. Where a party claims registration of a trademark which is valid, this would create a prima facie case in favour of the said party as has been observed in the case of Tabaq v. Tabaq (1987 SCMR 1090) and balance of convenience will also tilt in favour of the appellant/proprietor of the said trademark as infringement of its trademark affects its goodwill and reputation and will be likely to cause said party irreparable loss which cannot be compensated in monetary value. Therefore, the impugned order on this score alone is defective and illegal.
 It clearly provides in section 46(2) that in an action for infringement, all such reliefs by way of damages, injunctions and accounts can be availed by the proprietor of a trademark, and not as alternative to one another. Accordingly, it is apparent that the legislation has intended to clarify that where an injunction, damages and accounts all have been claimed together, an injunction would not be refused just because in addition to an injunction, damages and accounts have also been claimed. This aspect becomes further clear when repealed law namely Trademarks Act, 1940 is reviewed as no similar provisions were available therein, which are now available in the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. 
it appears from the said judgment that the reported cases referred to above namely, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1991 MLD 658, 1993 MLD 590 were neither referred nor considered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in arriving at the decision in the aforesaid case reported as Messrs Super Asia M.D. (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive v. Messrs Anwar Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2007 CLD 1181). Thus in light of the aforesaid cases, and as appellant's trademark SHAUKAT is wholly incorporated in respondent's trademark, the addition of word Crystal is of no consequence and does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion and deception and just because the respondent has added the word Crystal before SHAUKAT does not make respondent's trademark CRYSTAL SHAUKAT sufficiently dissimilar to the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. 
 It is also the case of the appellant that the respondent is trying not only to infringe its trademark but has also adopted a colour scheme of the packaging/wrapper identical to that of the appellant on which the respondent is also using the portrait of a person similar to a portrait of one of the predecessors of the appellant.
In light of the prima facie facts available on record as well as the aforesaid binding judgments of the honourable Supreme Court, and also the judgments of the High Court, it prima facie appears that Respondent has dishonestly adopted the trademark SHAUKAT which is the registered trademark of Appellant. Respondent's addition of the word CRYSTAL before the word SHAUKAT to make it Crystal Shaukat has no bearing or consequences and does not protect it from being liable for infringement of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. This is also as the public might assume that CRYSTAL SHAUKAT is yet another product of the same party which is selling products under the trademark SHAUKAT SOAP or is another quality or range of product and/or manufactured under permission or authorization of the owners of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP, which is being sold in the Pakistani market for decades.","

Messrs AZHAR ENTERPRISES through Proprietor---Respondent
 

","R.F.A. No.108 of 2000, decided on 30th March, 2009.",,,"Messrs National Tool Industry (Registered), appellant herein instituted a suit before learned District Judge, Rawalpindi under section 73 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, for permanent injunction and recovery of damages against the respondent. The respondent contested the suit and out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, 7(seven) issues were framed and the evidence of the parties was recorded in response thereto. Learned District Judge, Rawalpindi on conclusion of the trial, vide his judgment and decree dated 9-5-2000, dismissed the writ of the appellant, holding therein that the trade mark used by the defendant is distinct, leaving no similarity with the trade-mark of the respondent. While reaching the said conclusion, it was observed by the learned Court that the appellant has failed to prove that anyone has been deceived by the trademark of the defendant. with new technological evidence.","Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that tine appellant is a registered proprietor of the trademark vide Serial No.79351 with effect from 2-4-1983. The appellant is selling shovels bearing the trademark of one cancel and falls in the category of Tools and Instruments thrilling part of clause 8 of schedule 2. The defendant's trademark is identical in every respect to that one of the appellant's except that it contains two camels. He has added that Issues Nos.2 to 4 were decided in the impugned judgment in favour of the appellant; plaintiff and the findings of learned trial Court qua issues Nos.1, 5 and 6 were against the plaintiff/appellant which are now assailed in this appeal. Learned Court has failed to ascertain the fact that both the trade marks so merely resemble that there is every likelihood to deceive the customer. He added that when get-up is so close that it can be ascertained, merely on it's cursory look, no evidence of deception is needed. It was argued that in the comparison of trademarks, the Court has to examine and decide the controversy from various angles namely similarity and dissimilarity of trademarks, over all get-up and to find that unwaried purchasers can be deceived in view of close resemblance. The issue of deception can be decided by comparing both the trademarks side by side. Learned counsel submitted that U.W.2, in his cross-examination has admitted that trademark is pasted around the handle of the shovel horizontally. He then submitted that when trademark is pasted around the handle one camel disappears and the other becomes conspicuous. Learned counsel while discussing the evidence has submitted that D.W.1 appeared himself and D.Ws Nos.2 to 4 are the shopkeepers of Mochi Bazar, Rawalpindi. They slated that there was no complaint from the customers that they wanted to purchase the shovel with one camel but the shovel having the trademark of two cancels was sold to them. Learned counsel submitted heat no purchaser was brought to witness box but the sellers who sell the shovels of the defendant/respondent. The witnesses are interested witnesses and their statement cannot be relied upon.
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has submitted that the appellant is manufacturing shovel with it's trademark ""single camel"" and the same is registered. While the respondent is manufacturer of shovel carrying the label of ""two camels"". He went further to argue that onus to prove issues Nos.3 to 6 was on the plaintiff who failed to prove the same. P.W. 1 the star witness has not stated anything towards infringement of the trademark. He added that it was a primary responsibility of the appellant to prove infringement of the brand/label. There is remarkable difference between the two brands. The brand of the appellant conspicuously mentioned name of it's manufacturer ""National Tools"" while the brand of the respondent contains the name of it's manufacturer ""Azhar Enterprises"". The buyer, through a glance at the brand name, earl differentiate between the two. Learned counsel while referring to the case of ""Formica Corporation v. Pakistan Formica Ltd."" 1989 SCMR 361 contended that primary test to decide whether a trademark which was owned by another has become publics juris is to sec whether it's use by other persons is still calculated to deceive the public. Learned counsel then contended that where an unwary user is likely to be deceived, is the test wherefrom infringement of the trademark can be ascertained. Mere similarity of competing trademarks is not enough. What has to be adopted is that both the trademarks are so striking that an unwary purchaser would be deceived. Learned counsel in support of his contention has referred to the cases of ""Jamia Industries Ltd. v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another"" PLD 1984 SC 8, ""Insaf Soap Factory v. Lever 13rothers Port Sunlight Ltd."" PLD 1959 (W.P.) Lahore 381 and Bandenawaz Ltd. v. Registrar of Trade Marks. Karachi and another"" PLD 1967 Karachi 492. Learned counsel submitted that trademark should not be placed side try side to land out the similarity. He added that both the brand of trademarks should not be compared side by side as alleged by the appellant but infringement has to be tested while comparing one mark in the absence of outer. He supported his contention from the dictum laid down in the case of 'The Welcome Foundation Limited v. Messers Karachi Chemical Industries (Private) Limited"" 2000 YLR 1376.","The claim of the appellant for damages is permissible only when the damages claimed are asserted in the suit under each head separately and proved through cogent evidence. The appellant has failed to prove damages and his claim has rightly been declined by learned trial Court. Thus, the appeal to this extent is dismissed.
For the foregoing, this appeal is partially allowed, the judgment and decree of learned trial Court qua dismissal of the claim of the appellant for infringement of trademark is set aside, the suit of the plaintiff is decreed for permanent injunction, restraining the respondent from infringing the appellant's registered trademark. Parties are left to bear their own costs.

","Learned counsel for the respondent mainly defended the impugned judgment and decree of learned trial Court on the plea that the infringement of a registered trademark is essentially proved from evidence showing that get up of two trademarks/brands is similar and there is every likelihood of deception by an unwary purchaser. A plaintiff has to lead evidence in this regard and in the absence of such evidence, suit is not liable to be decreed. The contention of learned counsel for the respondent is not convincing. Similarly the observation of the learned Court, is that the plaintiffs failure to produce witness deposing that he fell victim to misunderstanding because of similarity of the trademarks is not well founded. The plaintiff was non-suited on this sole reason/plea, erroneously. Section 21 of the Trade Marks Act, 194.0 is relevant which reads as under:--
 
""21(1) Subject to the provisions of sect ions 22, 23 and 26, the registration of a person in the register as proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trademark or a registered riser thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it. as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either--
(a) as being used as a trade mark; or
(b) to import a reference to some person having the right either as a proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.""
Perusal of the above provision of law reflects that the legislature in it's own wisdom has used the terms ""likely to deceive"" and ""cause confusion"". The term ""likely to deceive"" is wide enough to negate the stance of' the respondent drat absolute proof is needed to make out a case of infringement of trademark. A plaintiff can establish the case of infringement of trademark, by proving that impugned trademark has caused confusion or it so nearly resemble with registered trademark that there is likelihood of it's deception, without calling the witness in the witness box, who was so deceived.
 
Necessity of leading evidence to prove the infringement of trademark came up for consideration before the superior Courts and the issue was examined in the following cases, as under:--
(i) The Privy Council in the case of ""Lever v. Goodwin"" (1887) 36 Ch. D.1) observed that in the matter where there is no evidence that no one has in fact being deceived is immaterial. It is not necessary that there should be evidence that no one in fact had been deceived. It is enough it the plaintiff satisfies the Court that lire defendant's goods marked in the manner so as to lead the purchaser to believe that there being the goods of the plaintiff.
(ii) In the case of ""Messrs Burney's Industrial and Commercial Company Limited v. Rehman"" PLD 1983 Kar.357, Honourable Sindh High Court observed that evidence of an expert witness or an intelligent customer or even a customer of average intelligence who takes ordinary care while buying goods in the market, world not be relevant as the lest is that of an unwary purchaser and it is only the evidence of an unwary purchaser which would be relevant. Learned Court went further and observed that some witnesses for the plaintiff, in a trademark infringement action, may state that they were deceived by the infringing mark whereas other witnesses giving evidence for the defendant may depose to the contrary. It may, therefore, be observed that invariably the Court, alter taking into consideration the two marks, the registered and the infringing, decide whether the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to he deceived.
Survey of above case-law and the provisions of section 21 of the Act, 1940 (now repealed) brings me to conclude that infringement of trademark cannot be proved through bringing the buyers in the witness box. Each side can lead the evidence of it's own choice and pass through the test of cross-examination. The Court can examine the material relevant evidence and two marks and decide that the unwary purchaser is or is not likely to be deceived.
Learned Court has non-suited the plaintiff and dismissed the suit on the solitary ground that no witness was produced in evidence to prove that at the time of purchase he (the witness) was deceived. Learned Court has not only committed material irregularity while reaching this conclusion but has neglected to follow the law settled through various judgments of the superior Courts. The impugned judgment and decree is based on wrong assumption of law and as such it is not sustainable.
Now, I will advert to the instant controversy. On mere examination of both the trademarks, it is evident that colour scheming, border, design and get up, is similar and closely resembled. Normally, in a picture sky is portrayed in blue while soil/ground is shown as green. In the registered trademark, the background is yellow and ground is red with grey strips. The respondent has dishonestly followed the same pattern and used the same colour scheme, opting to make his label identical and similar to that one of the appellant. No doubt that both the labels are worded differently. The label of the appellant comprises of the word ""Improved"" while the respondent's, label carries the words ""'Two Camels"". The address mentioned in the former label is National Tool Industry Chowk Kotli Behramji Sialkot No.3, while Azhar Enterprises Umar Road, Rawalpindi is the address mentioned in the latter label. Lower portion of both the labels is similarly worded. Both the labels comprise three parts and their colour scheming and size create the element of deception. No matter both the labels are examined side by side, or one in the absence of other. The deception becomes more conspicuous when the label is affixed at the handle of the shovel, which is round in shape. If infringing label is fixed at the top of the handle one of the camels becomes invisible and gives impression of one camel instead of two camels. An unwary purchaser in the instant case is whether a farmer or a labourer or an illiterate person, as the tool is meant for this class of users. Such class of purchasers cannot distinguish the label by the English words used therein. They normally purchase the product by device or get up. This aspect cannot be ignored.

(hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") through its Chief Executive Mr. Habib Ahmad against the order dated 19.2.2015, passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala in Civil Suit No.2 of 2012 whereby application of the appellant filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction against Messrs Shaukat Brothers Soap Manufacturers (Pvt.) Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as ""the respondent"") has been dismissed.
The background of the case is that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction against the respondent. Along with the suit it filed an application for temporary injunction. In the suit it was averred that the appellant's Trade Mark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" is registered under Registration Nos.25850 dated 30.6.1956 and 44332 (in Class 3) dated 8.11.1965 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Trade Mark""). The said Trade Mark registrations were originally obtained in the name of Abdul Ghani, Abdul Hamid, Manzoor Ahmed, Muhammad Siddique, Mushtaq Ahmed trading as Shaukat Soap Factory, Thanewala Bazar, Gujranwala. According to the extract of the certified copy of the registration No.44332, pursuant to a request for change of ownership on Form No. TM-24, on 15th August, 1979 Messrs Shaukat Soap Factory Ltd. having the same address was registered as the subsequent proprietor of the Trademark w.e.f. 9.8.1972. Based on the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company filed along with the suit it has been submitted that the company incorporated in the name of Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., the appellant, has taken over the running business and concern carried out at Gujranwala in the name and style of Shaukat Soap Factory; that this subsequent merger is being recorded with the Trademarks Registry and the appellant claims that it is the true and bona fide owner of the aforesaid Trademark and that it has the exclusive right under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 to use or authorize the use of the aforesaid Trademark.
The respondent on the other hand contested the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction by contending that the Trademark Registration Nos.25850 and 44332 for the registration of the words ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" are invalid as these words cannot be considered to be of a distinctive character under section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 and that the word ""SHAUKAT"" is a surname according to its ordinary significance; that the said word cannot be registered as a Trademark as it is free to be used by anyone who has the name Shaukat. The respondent further asserted that the Trademark ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" is a distinctive Trademark and sufficiently different from the Trademark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" so there is no possibility of any confusion or deception in the market.
At the time of the decision of the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. the above said factual background and information/material was available with the learned Additional District Judge. However, in her impugned judgment she has proceeded to decide the matter on the ground that there is very minor similarity between the trademarks ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" and ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" as there is only a common usage of colour yellow by the respondents similar to those of the appellant on their wrapper in which the soap is packed. She has relied on the case law reported as Messrs Super Asia v. Anwar Industries (2007 CLD 1181) stating that it has been held in the said case that the trademark ""Asia"" and ""Super Asia"" were held to be different names and not confusingly similar. Lastly she has observed that both the parties are real brothers and since they have inherited the business, as such they have similar rights and claims on the basis of which it has been held in the impugned judgment that the appellant has failed to establish a good prima facie arguable case and, therefore, observed that there was no need to discuss other ingredients for the grant of temporary injunction due to a change in law.","The stance of learned counsel for the respondent that the trademark ""SHAUKAT"" is hit by section 6(1)(d) of the Trademarks Act, 1940 (which is similar in scope as section 14 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) as such it was not registerable and thus a prima facie case is not made out in favour of the appellant, is not sustainable for the reason that section 43 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark the fact that a person is registered as a proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trademark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof, whereas section 44 ibid provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark, the original registration of the trademark shall, after five years from the date of its original registration, be taken to be valid in all respects unless the registration was obtained by fraud or unless it offends the provisions of section 14(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. 
A Court dealing with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. has to consider which of the parties has a prima facie case, balance of convenience or inconvenience and likely to suffer irreparable loss in case of grant or refusal of interim injunction.
The respondent has adopted SHAUKAT and has added the word CRYSTAL before it. Therefore, in essence the question is whether addition of a word to a registered trademark, and in this case which has been used for a long time, makes the two marks sufficiently different based on which there is no possibility of confusion or deception.
","In the circumstances, the impugned order is set-aside and the respondent is restrained from using the word ""SHAUKAT"" as a trademark either alone or along with the word ""CRYSTAL"" or in conjunction with any other word or device along with a wrapper of soap which is yellow and black in colour scheme, design and get up and depicts the portrait of their predecessor in the same place and position as that of the appellant till the decision of the main suit. It is, however, pointed out that no observation made by this Court in this order would be taken into account while deciding the main suit which would be decided on the basis of evidence recorded and the arguments of the parties at the relevant time. The instant appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms.
","During the course of arguments learned counsel for the respondent has failed to answer the query of this Court as to whether or not the claim of the respondent relates to a disputed business built around trademark SHAUKAT SOAP which they were also claiming through common usage or inheritance.
The law provides a proper mechanism and procedure for seeking revocation (section 73) and invalidity of registration (section 80) to an aggrieved party for redressal of its grievance, if it considers that a trademark in dispute was wrongfully registered by its proprietor. No such application/petition appears to have been filed by the respondent before the Court/Forum of Competent Jurisdiction. In the absence of filing of any such formal application, the argument of respondent to that effect cannot be considered. Also unless any act of fraud is prima facie floating on the surface of a trademark registration, the trademark registration, which is obtained after thorough examination and publication of notice in the Trademarks Journal for inviting public objections, must be considered to be validly registered and be enforced to provide certainty to its owner for protection of its registered rights.
The appellant company has exclusive right, reputation and good will therein. Where a party claims registration of a trademark which is valid, this would create a prima facie case in favour of the said party as has been observed in the case of Tabaq v. Tabaq (1987 SCMR 1090) and balance of convenience will also tilt in favour of the appellant/proprietor of the said trademark as infringement of its trademark affects its goodwill and reputation and will be likely to cause said party irreparable loss which cannot be compensated in monetary value. Therefore, the impugned order on this score alone is defective and illegal.
 It clearly provides in section 46(2) that in an action for infringement, all such reliefs by way of damages, injunctions and accounts can be availed by the proprietor of a trademark, and not as alternative to one another. Accordingly, it is apparent that the legislation has intended to clarify that where an injunction, damages and accounts all have been claimed together, an injunction would not be refused just because in addition to an injunction, damages and accounts have also been claimed. This aspect becomes further clear when repealed law namely Trademarks Act, 1940 is reviewed as no similar provisions were available therein, which are now available in the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. 
it appears from the said judgment that the reported cases referred to above namely, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1991 MLD 658, 1993 MLD 590 were neither referred nor considered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in arriving at the decision in the aforesaid case reported as Messrs Super Asia M.D. (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive v. Messrs Anwar Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2007 CLD 1181). Thus in light of the aforesaid cases, and as appellant's trademark SHAUKAT is wholly incorporated in respondent's trademark, the addition of word Crystal is of no consequence and does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion and deception and just because the respondent has added the word Crystal before SHAUKAT does not make respondent's trademark CRYSTAL SHAUKAT sufficiently dissimilar to the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. 
 It is also the case of the appellant that the respondent is trying not only to infringe its trademark but has also adopted a colour scheme of the packaging/wrapper identical to that of the appellant on which the respondent is also using the portrait of a person similar to a portrait of one of the predecessors of the appellant.
In light of the prima facie facts available on record as well as the aforesaid binding judgments of the honourable Supreme Court, and also the judgments of the High Court, it prima facie appears that Respondent has dishonestly adopted the trademark SHAUKAT which is the registered trademark of Appellant. Respondent's addition of the word CRYSTAL before the word SHAUKAT to make it Crystal Shaukat has no bearing or consequences and does not protect it from being liable for infringement of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. This is also as the public might assume that CRYSTAL SHAUKAT is yet another product of the same party which is selling products under the trademark SHAUKAT SOAP or is another quality or range of product and/or manufactured under permission or authorization of the owners of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP, which is being sold in the Pakistani market for decades.","

SHOW-CAUSE NOTICES Nos.18 AND 19 OF 2010 issues to Messrs ACE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES: In the matter of
 

","File Nos.3 [REG/COMP/BMW/SEC.10/CCP/09 and 4/REG/COMP/H.D/SEC.10 /CCP/09, decided on 16th August, 2010.",,,"Messrs Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft and Messrs H-D Michigan L.L.C. (hereinafter referred to as 'BMW' and 'HD', respectively; and collectively referred to as the 'Complainants') filed complaints under Section 10 of the Ordinance read with Regulation 17 of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007 alleging that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using Complainants' registered trademarks on its products. It was further alleged that such use of Complainants' trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' and is prohibited in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance. The contents of the complaints are summarized as follows:
That BMW is a Company organized under and existing under the laws of Germany, having its registered office at Petuelring 130, BMW House, 80809 Munich, Germany. That BMW in the year 1917 developed the famous logo of BMW. The idea .of this logo was primarily based on the Circular Design of Aircraft propeller as well as the blue and white segments were reflective of the Bavarian coat of arms. 
That the goods sold and business conducted using trademark, service mark, company name and trade name BMW and BMW Logo throughout the world by BMW have been widely advertised in international magazines, periodicals and news papers which also have circulation in Pakistan and/or most have been seen by the Pakistani public and BMW has spent huge amount of money for this purpose which has resulted in the tremendous awareness of the trademark, trade name, service mark and company name of BMW and BMW Logo which are recognized by the traders and the general public throughout the world including Pakistan as originating and/or having association with BMW or under its authority.
That BMW has authorized Messrs Dewan Farooq Motors Limited, a Pakistani Company as authorized Importers/Dealers/Distributors for its BMW cars in Pakistan. .
That BMW, over a period of time, expanded its range of goods to other allied or related goods as well as large variety of fashion and luxury merchandise, accessories, etc., and in order to distinguish its goods, business and services from those of others, BMW either itself or through its subsidiaries, licensees and/or affiliates uses amongst other BMW as Trademark logo. Businesses and services include; cars, car accessories, automobile parts, motorcycles, bikes, mountain bikes, cruise bikes, kids bikes, bags and various other products such as golf kits, golf balls, golf sticks, wallets, key chains, fountain pens, ball points, umbrellas, locks, clothing, jackets, leather jackets, leather bags, jeans, caps, sport shirts, T-Shirts, cigarette cases and lighters etc.
That HD is an American motorcycle manufacturer. Founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the first decade of the 20th century, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great depression.
That HD also carries on, either itself or through its licensees, affiliates of associated companies, a wide range of manufacturing such as motorcycle, its parts and accessories and other wide range of products including but not limited to motorcycle clothing, motorcycle sports apparels including leather jackets, lifestyles accessories, which are marked using HD's trademarks.
There is no authorized dealer of HD in Pakistan and they have not authorized AGI to use their Trade Mark on its products.
 It has been alleged in the complaint that AGI is manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, exporting leather jackets and is fraudulently and without authorization using HD's registered trademarks on its products. It has been alleged that such use of HD's trade mark is fraudulent, mala fide and constitutes the acts of 'Deceptive Marketing Practices' in terms of Section 10 (2) (a), (b) & (c) of the Ordinance. HD has also appended the images from the website of AGI. (Annex-A and B to this Order).
 with new technological evidence.","Upon receipt of the complaint, the Commission asked the Complainants' through its counsel, vide its letter dated 9-10-2009 to attend a meeting at the offices of the Commission in Islamabad on 14-10-2009 and to provide the following supporting documents/information within ten days of receipt of the letter:--
 
(i) A copy of authorization to act on behalf of the Complainants',
 
(ii) Certified copies of the Trade Mark Registration Certificates',
 
(iii) Whether any proceedings regarding the captioned matter between the Complainants and AGI have already been decided by any court of law or the Trade Mark Registry or by any other statutory body? If yes, then to provide the Commission with all pleadings and Orders passed thereon;
 
(iv) Whether the Complainants every authorized AGI to manufacture the leather jackets in the past for the Complainants?
 
(v) Details relating to the legal status of AGI;
 
(vi) When and how did it come to the Complainants' knowledge that AGI was allegedly using their trade mark? ;
 
(vii) What other forms of advertisement is AGI using besides advertising the jackets online for sale? ;
 
(viii) Whether the Complainants are aware of any sales made by AGI regarding the products advertised, bearing their trade mark? And to provide any sales receipts or purchase orders, if any, of those sales;
 
(ix) Whether the Complainants are also manufacturing and selling similar products themselves?
","Hence, keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am of the considered view that, deceptive marketing in terms of Section 10 of the Ordinance has been carried out by AGI and the fraudulent use of the trademark by AGI was very much capable of harming the business interest of the complainants in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) and (d) of the Ordinance.
Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Ordinance, however, the approach of the representative of AGI needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and even amended their website immediately after receipt of letter from the Commission. In addition to the fact that he admitted the violation of the Ordinance not only at the enquiry stage but also during the course of hearing and cooperated by submitting all the record requisitioned by the Commission and apologizing and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit. I am, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 2,50,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, AGI is reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Ordinance.
In terms of what has been stated above both the Show Cause Notices Nos. 18 and 19 of 2010 issued to AGI are hereby disposed.
 

","The Complainant's counsel vide its letter dated December 21, 2009, provided the Commission with the fax numbers of AGI and also requested that substituted mode of service may please be adopted for serving the complaints to AGI.
The Complaints were again sent through fax and through courier vide letter dated 22-12-2009. This time the Complaints were received by the Respondent both through fax and through courier.
 
AGI vide its letters dated 6-1-2010 filed identical reply to both the Complaints, which reads as follows:
""That the Respondent is neither any incorporated concern nor a registered firm rather a small businessman under sole proprietorship. On initiation of business desirous to have some website and after having got prepared the same it was placed on web.
 
That the Respondent having no knowledge about such type of special laws innocently offered the garments from trade, with no intention to deceive any person in the universe in any manner whatsoever. However, if this hurt the Complainants, I am Sorry for the act and ready to amend the same and change the website accordingly rather has asked for it.""

The enquiry officers after analyzing and examining the Complaints and the above correspondence concluded the enquiry by producing the Enquiry Report dated 17-5-2010 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Enquiry Report""). The Enquiry Report concluded as follows:
""Though the conduct and attitude of the Respondent may appear to be innocent and ignorant of special laws such as the Ordinance, however, we are inclined with the legal principle that ignorance of law can be of no excuse. Therefore, in view of the above facts, annexures appended herewith, images of the website of the Respondent, and clear admission of the Respondent that, prima facie, there is a violation of Section 10(1) of the Ordinance and in particular clauses (a), (d) of subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance, on part of the Respondent.""
At the hearing on 17-6-2010, Mr. Hasan Irfan Khan submitted his analysis of the data provided by AGI and emphasized that the documents did not conform with the statements made at the previous hearing by the representatives of AGI. According to Mr. Khan AGI had a higher turnover than stated by Mr. Tayyab Ali at the first hearing. Mr. Tayyab Ali in response once again apologized and said that he has not lied to the Commission and has correctly stated the facts. He further added that in Sialkot several undertakings are engaged in such practices and they need to be educated through their chamber of commerce that they are in violation of the Ordinance. He filed the undertaking before the Commission admitting the violation of the Ordinance and assuring future compliance of the Ordinance in letter and spirit.
Having gone through all the documents available on the record. The main issue which emerges in the matter is whether AGI has engaged itself into the deceptive marketing practices in violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance?
Since, AGI's admission, firstly at the enquiry stage vide its letter dated 6-1-2010 and subsequently vide its undertaking before me on 17-6-2010, leaves no doubt that they were using the trademarks of the Complainants on the images available on their website. During the hearing it was also admitted by AGI that, although they do not have the resources but advertising embellished details such as the capital, staff, tenure of the business always adds to the strength and popularity of the company amongst prospective customers and helps in fetching more orders from abroad. This admission in itself speaks volumes that, the proprietor of AGI although claims to be innocent and ignorant of law, is not that innocent at all. Further the allegations by the Complainant that their logos were used on the website by AGI knowingly that they are famous renowned logos owned by other companies, was never refuted by AGI and although not expressly admitted by the AGI but the statements made by them implies that the trademarks of Complainants' were used owing to their popularity amongst the public at large. The only justification which was afforded by the representatives of AGI was 'ignorance of law'.
During the course of hearing, I was informed by the representatives of AGI that as soon as AGI received letter from the Commission at the enquiry stage they removed all the images containing the registered logos of the complainant and have also amended their website. However, the counsel for the Complainant opposed this and submitted that on the following link the AGI's page showing the image of BMW jacket is still available.
I am least impressed with the justification afforded by AGI for violation of Section 10 of the Ordinance that, they were not aware that 'they were in breach and/or in contravention of any law'. It is pertinent to point out that 'ignorance of law is no excuse' is primarily based on the legal maxims Ignorantia juris non excusat which means ignorance of the law does not excuse or Ignorantia legis neminem excusat which means ignorance of the law excuses no one. The rationale behind these maxims is that if ignorance was an excuse, a person charged with criminal offence or a subject of a civil law suit would merely claim that he/she or it was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even though the person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law imputes knowledge of all laws to all persons within the jurisdiction no matter how transiently, especially to the laws which relates to the business which the person is involved in.
Furthermore, in the matter of Ahmad Bakhsh and 3 others v. Managing Director, (Superintending Engineer) WAPDA Electric Supply Company, Multan, 1995 PLC 536, it was held as follows:
""Nobody, could plead ignorance of provisions of Constitution or any other codified law, because after such law was notified in official Gazette; presumption would be that everybody living in country would have knowledge thereof'
Keeping in view the above legal and factual position, I am inclined to hold that, plea of ignorance cannot be accepted as a valid justification or defence, at all. Moreover, the representative of AGI himself admitted that the information provided on the website regarding the establishment of AGI, its staff, its capital and ancillary details are only provided to build a good image and to fetch more orders from abroad, hence any plea of innocence does not seem tenable. In view of this clear intent and objective, it only makes the use of the subject trademarks as fraudulent on part of AGI.
With reference to the allegation that the unauthorized/fraudulent use of Complainant's registered trade marks by AGI is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant in terms of clause (a) subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Ordinance read with subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Ordinance.
The Complainants' counsel has submitted documents and copies of the certificate making it clear that the trademarks used by AGI on its website are exclusively owned by the Complainant and the documents available on the record also establish that the logos are well recognized and holds goodwill to themselves and are not only well known in the public at large but are also well recognized.
The documents and evidence available on the record such as the website images and the catalogues submitted by the Complainants establish that they are involved in the manufacturing and sale of the products, which AGI advertised on its website. There is no doubt that, the website of AGI is accessible from any where around the world and the products advertised and offered for sale on AGI's website are same as the ones manufactured and marketed by the Complainants, as well. In presence of the website images of AGI and their admission regarding unauthorized use of trade marks of the Complainant, there is no doubt in reaching to the conclusion that the information disseminated by AGI through its website is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainants with reference to the products advertised therein.

Messrs HAROON SWEET FACTORY and another---Respondents

","R.F.A. No. 108 of 2006, decided on 16th October, 2017.","13th July, 2017.","MUHAMMAD FARRUKH IRFAN KHAN, J.","The brief facts out of which this appeal has arisen are that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants/respondents from infringement of its Trade Mark Hilal Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant has been manufacturing and marketing sweets and candies bearing the said trade mark along with its label/wrapper in a particular colour scheme and design since 1988. It was also asserted that due to good quality, the sweets and candies of the appellant under this specific trade mark and label/wrapper have acquired great reputation and goodwill throughout the country. It was claimed that the said trademark along with its colour scheme and design was pending registration in class 30 under application No.1471128 and the copyrights in the said packaging of Hilal Khopra Candy Sweets is duly protected under the Trade Mark and Copy Rights Laws. Along with the suit the appellant attached certificate, regarding pendency of trademark registration application in class 30. The appellant alleged that by adopting a trademark Haroon Khopra Candy Sweets with identical packaging/label/wrapper, the respondents are not only infringing the appellant's trademark rights but also passing off their goods as the goods of the appellant and are thus continuously deceiving the appellant's customers besides causing financial loss to it.
The respondents defended the suit by filing their written statement and raised a preliminary objection that the suit was filed by an incompetent person. On merit it was pleaded that the appellant has merely filed a copy of the application for registration of the trademark which does not confer any exclusive right or cause of action in favour of the appellant; that it was at the most a suit for passing off which was to be filed before the Court of competent jurisdiction i.e. Civil Court and that the Court of District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the instant suit and adjudicate upon it. They refuted the plea of the appellant that Haroon Khopra Candy or its wrapper/label are similar or identical to Hilal Khopra Candy and its wrapper/label and submitted that as no exclusive right is vested in the appellant it cannot seek restraint against use of a label/wrapper having different colour scheme and design by the respondents under their trademark Haroon Khopra Candy. It was asserted that the appellant had no cause of action. with contradictory witness statements.","1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for permanent injunction, against the defendants as prayed for? OPP
2. Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action to file the suit? OPD
3. Whether the suit for plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed in view of preliminary objection No.2? OPD
4. Whether the defendant is entitled to recover special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C. from the plaintiff? OPD
5. Relief.
","I hold that the colour scheme, design and getup of label/wrapper of respondent/defendant Ex-P-22 is deceptively and confusingly similar or nearly resemble the colour scheme, design and getup of the label/wrapper of Appellant/Plaintiff Ex-P-16 and is likely to cause confusion and deception to an unwary purchaser. Issue No. 2 is therefore, answered in favour of Appellant/Plaintiff and against the respondent/defendant. 
In view of my findings on issue No.1, it is held that appellant plaintiff has got a locus standi and a valid cause of action to file the suit. The findings of the learned Trial Court on this issue are over turned and it is decided in favour of the appellant/plaintiff against the respondent defendant.
These issues have already been decided in favour of the appellants. The findings of the learned Trial Court on these two issues are affirmed.
In view of my above findings the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2005 is set aside and suit of the appellant/plaintiff is decreed as prayed for with no order as to cost.
","From bare perusal of the wrappers/labels of both the parties it is to be noted that appellant's product packing Ex.P-16 comprises of dark blue label in which the dark blue shade becomes lighter going right side. The word Hilal is written in yellow on the left upper corner WHILE the label/wrapper of the respondent also has a dark blue, light blue, white, green and red colour scheme design and get up with only a few points of difference here and there as compared to that of the appellant's label/wrapper described above. 
PW-1 on behalf of the appellant deposed that defendants are marketing/selling 'Haroon Khopra Candy' sweets in a wrapper which is almost similar to that of the plaintiff's and as such they are deceiving the ordinary customers. On the other hand the respondent's witness DW-1 has deposed that the plaintiff has filed a false case against the defendant. He further stated that plaintiff's product is being sold by the name and style of 'Hilal Khopra Candy' whereas the name of defendant's product is 'Haroon Khopra Candy'; that the trademark of defendant's company is in the name of 'Haroon' while the name of plaintiff's trademark is 'Hilal'; that the defendant company is not copying the plaintiff's trademark. it can be concluded that these trademarks are identical. Moreover, it has come in the evidence of the defendant that Khopra is being sold by 30/35 companies in blue colour, as such it is concluded that even if plaintiff is prior user, even then it would not give right to the plaintiff to claim exclusive right in respect of' words Khopra Candy, hence it is concluded that the plaintiff was unable to prove issue.
The above findings of the learned Trial Court proceed on wrong premises. The Registration Certificate dated 20th November, 2014 of the plaintiff Ex.P-26 has not been taken into consideration in its true perspective. Only the disclaimer appearing on the Registration Certificate that appellant/plaintiff has no exclusive right in respect of Khopra Candy has been relied. Thus the Trial Court has erred in mixing the disclaimer on the word Khopra Candy with the rights that the appellant/plaintiff has claimed by virtue of the Registration of the features of the whole label i.e. colour scheme, design, get-up etc. In addition to this, the learned Trial Court has committed a further error by overlooking the established principle of law that for maintaining a passing off action registration of a trademark is not a requirement and even though there may be a disclaimer on any particular feature on a wrapper/label.
It has to be noted that under the Trademark Ordinance, 2001 a Mark has been defined by section 2(xxiv) as follows:-
""Mark includes, in particular a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name including personal name, signature, word, letter, numeral, figurative element, colour, sound or any combination thereof.""
Thus the law envisages each one of the above features namely, inter alia, a name, a word, figurative element, colour, etc., to be a mark by itself and goes on to further specify that any combination of these features would be a mark also. In the market place, generally for consumer products, it is usual for companies to market their products in attractive colourful labels/wrappers/packaging, which often carries a word, a figurative element, a particular colour scheme, design and get up. Each one of these features, as the definition of the 'Mark"" envisages, is a mark in itself. When one feature of a label consisting of a combination of marks is adopted or copied, infringement or copying of that feature (a mark) takes place which is liable to be remedied and it will not be a valid defence by a defendant that he has not adopted/imitated other features of the label mark, which may be different. Thus when a label comprising of a colour scheme, design and get up is copied/imitated by adopting a similar colour scheme, design and get up but with a different word, infringement to the extent of colour scheme design, and get up would take place and can be injuncted to that extent. Similarly if a word is copied but not the colour scheme, design and get up, the infringement takes place only to the extent of word mark and it will not be open to a defendant to allege that due to different word mark, or different colour scheme, design, get up, in the respective labels/packaging, there will be no likelihood of confusion or deception. This aspect has been explained/expounded in a number of reported cases, in a different context, by holding that when one or more of the essential features of a mark or a label is infringed, infringement takes place, for example, in the cases of ""Cecil De Cordova and others v. Vick Chemical Company"" (PLD 1951 Privy Council 108), Jamia Industries Ltd v. Caltex Oil (Pak) Ltd. and another (PLD 1984 SC 8), ""Mehran Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs Chiltan Ghee Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. and others"" (2001 SCMR 967) I would, therefore, hold that the plea that respondent's/defendant's mark is ""HAROON KHOPRA CANDY"" whereas Appellant's/Plaintiff's mark is ""HILAL KHOPRA CANDY"" and that the former's label/wrapper, colour scheme, design and get up, (Ex.P-22) which otherwise is confusing and nearly resembling to that of latter's label/wrapper colour Scheme, design and get-up (Ex.P-16) be considered to be different is not a legally sustainable defence and must be rejected.

SHAN FOOD INDUSTRIES---Appellant
 
Versus
 
EASTERN PRODUCTS (PVT.) LTD and others---Respondents
 

","Civil Appeal No.223-K of 2011, decided on 4th July, 2012.
(Against the judgment dated 29-12-2010 passed by High Court of Sindh, Karachi in M.A. No.55 of 2004).",,,"This Appeal impugns the Judgment of the learned High Court of Sindh (Karachi) in Miscellaneous Application No.55 of 2004 whereby the appeal filed by the respondent was allowed. Consequently the Order of the Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26-6-2004 dismissing the application of the respondent for registration of its trade mark i.e. ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" was set aside.
 Briefly stated the facts of the matter are that the appellant has in its favour a registered trade mark known as ""SHAN"" in respect of spices since the year 1985. In 1991 an advertisement appeared in the Trade mark Journal for ""EASTERN SHAN TEA"" for tea in respect of the respondent which was opposed by the appellant. The Registrar of Trade Marks concluded that the previously registered trade mark of the appellant is identical with the proposed trade mark of the respondent as the word ""SHAN"" is common and a prominent feature in both the trade marks. Consequently the respondent's trade mark was not only identical but deceptively similar to the appellant's and hence registration would be in violation of sections 10(1) as well as 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 with the result that registration of the respondent's trade mark was refused. As noted above vide impugned Judgment the findings of the Registrar were set aside.
 under heightened security.","In support of the appeal Mr. Sultan Ahmed Sheikh, learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that the word ""SHAN"" is prominently displayed on the labels of both the products in yellow alphabets with a red background and consequently even to the naked eye the proposed trade mark of the respondent is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the appellant. Hence the common man/house wife who goes shopping for his/her daily needs which includes spices, tea etc., could easily be led to believe that the respondent's products i.e. tea is manufactured by the appellant and would purchase the same thereby eroding the goodwill and reputation which the appellant have built for their own products i.e. spices since the year 1985 when their trade mark was registered. Hence per learned Advocate Supreme Court the registration of the respondent's trade mark for tea would be in violation of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 (which was the then applicable law) as it was likely to deceive and cause confusion amongst the minds of the general public as to the ownership of the same. Similarly per learned Advocate Supreme Court the said proposed registration would also be in violation of section 10(1) of the Act (Ibid) which prohibits registration of an identical or a similar trade mark of a previously registered article or similar trade mark. In support of his submissions learned Advocate Supreme Court has relied upon Unilever PLC., A British Company of Port Sunlight Wirral Merseyside, England v. R.B. Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Karachi (1999 MLD 1447), Mars Incorporated v. Pakistan Mineral Water Bottling Plant (Pvt.) Ltd. Through Chief Executive/Director/Secretary (2001 MLD 39), Seven-up Company v. Kohinoor thread Ball Factory and 3 others (PLD 1990 SC 314), Messrs Alpha Sewing Machine Company v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (PLD 1990 SC 1074) and Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba (also trading as Toshiba Corporation) v. Ch. Muhammad Altaf (trading as Murad Industries (Regd.) and another (PLD 1991 SC 27).
 In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) learned Advocate Supreme Court has submitted that this Court came to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" for soft drinks when proposed to be used for wool, thread and soap etc. would not cause any deception or confusion in terms of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 on the ground that the manufacturing and marketing methods of both these products are different as also the category of the consumers and outlets for sale etc. Hence with so many prominent variables all pertaining to the goods and consumers thereof the mere identity of the trade marks could not justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar and the High Court i.e. in favour of registration of the subsequent trade mark viz. seven up for wool, thread and soap. However per learned Advocate Supreme Court, registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala was refused on the ground that both products have the same sale points, and outlet points are quite often the same and so also the consumers served are largely of the same category and their features are common. Per learned Advocate Supreme Court this reasoning which convinced this Court to refuse registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala squarely applies in the present case as both spices and tea are available at the same sale points i.e. in general stores, the category of consumers are the same viz. the common public etc.
","In view of the all foregoing facts and circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that both parties trade marks/logos are quite similar even to the naked eye, the sale outlets are the same, the consumers are the same viz. the general public and hence it is more than probable that the product being offered by the respondent i.e. tea would be connected to the product of the appellant; viz. spices which would thus result in confusion and deception and would be detrimental for the appellant as well as that of the general public because the trade mark laws are not only made for the protection of the owner of the trade mark but also of the general public. Hence the proposed registration of the respondents trade mark would be in violation of section 8(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. So, also section 10(1) thereof would be violated as the appellant's trade mark was registered much before the respondents filed their application for registration of their trade mark.
For all the foregoing reasons this Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent No.1 is directed not to use the word/logo ""SHAN"" for its product i.e. tea, at all.
 

 
","We have also perused the original record of the Registrar of trade marks from which it is quite clear that the respondent's application was in fact dated 15-3-2001 and as such the time for filing of Opposition would expire on 15-5-2001. So also on 10-5-2001 the first request on form TM-55 was filed by the appellant for extension of time up to 15-6-2001 which was allowed by the Registrar on 7-6-2001. Thereafter as per diary of the Registrar three other applications were filed on 13-6-2001, 14-7-2001 and 16-8-2001 for extension of time by one month each up to 15-9-2001 which was again allowed and in the meanwhile the opposition in fact was filed on 8-9-2001. In these circumstances we are of the opinion that in terms of section 76 of the Trade Marks Rules which provides for a maximum extension in time up to six months for filing the Opposition, the Appellant's Opposition has in fact been filed within such time limitation after the Registrar had allowed such extensions. For all the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the opposition filed by the appellant was within time.
As to the merits of the case, it would be seen that the essential feature of section 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is that it prohibits registration of a trade mark which is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. In this regard, per the cases decided by this Court from time to time in order to come to a conclusion whether there is any deception or confusion, the two competing trade marks have to be kept side by side and thereafter the conclusion reached whether, a mark so nearly resembles another as to cause deception or confusion and this is not in exercise of discretion by a Tribunal but a finding of fact. In this regard reference may be made to Jamia Industries Ltd. (Supra) wherein this Court came to the conclusion that the mark ""Caltex"" having the features of a Crescent and star was similar to the mark ""JAMIA"" which also had a crescent and star and this would cause confusion and deception. Accordingly Zafar Hussain Mirza, J (as his Lordship then was) writing, for the Court held that both sections 8(a) and 10(1) squarely apply to the facts of the case and consequently registration of the appellant's trade mark ""JAMIA"" in 'the same category (Oils and Lubricants) was refused in view of the previously registered, trade mark of Caltex Oil of respondent in the said category.
In the case of Seven-up Company (Supra) as observed above this Court came, to the conclusion that the trade mark ""Seven-up"" of the Appellant's Company does not cause any confusion or deception (when used for wool, thread, soap and sports goods etc. as the goods are entirely different, their manufacturing and marketing methods are different and so also the categories of customers served is not the same as well as the outlets. Hence with so many variables the mere identity of the trade mark would not just justify interference in the conclusion drawn by the Registrar or the High Court with regard to the deception and confusion i.e. their being none. However insofar as Seven-up for soft drink and Pan Masala, this court came to the conclusion that often their sale points and outlets are the same and the consumers served are largely of the same category hence although both products are differently classified from the consumers point of view they are in the same category of light refreshment. Consequently there was a likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their origin with the result that the subsequent trade mark for Seven-up Pan Masala was not allowed. It was further observed by this Court that the applicants for registration of Seven-up for Pan Masala had a wide and open field to choose from. They decided upon the trade name of another which also happens to be name of the Company which has heavily invested in that trade name and good will appurtenant to it. With that real likelihood of deception and confusion it was clearly a case where registration should have been refused.
Finally and conclusively a visual comparison has to be made between the wrappers/packing of the products and if it is found that they are substantially the same then the decision has to be made in favour of the previous trade mark/user. It may be noted that the afore-going principles and considerations are not absolutely essential in order to reach the correct conclusion regarding deception etc. In fact there may be some variables as has been illustrated, above. However this much is certain that where the sale outlets and potential consumers are the same and the two trade marks are more or less alike, confusion is bound to take place.
Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand we would note that spices and tea are usually available at the same general store and the potential customers are the general public as these are item's of daily use. Similarly the method of advertisements is generally the same i.e. electronic and print media as well as bill boards. For example the person going to a general store for his or her monthly, weekly or daily shopping in this country would normally buy spices and tea. Hence it is well established that the consumers of both the items are the same as well as the sale outlets. Insofar the nature of goods is concerned it may be noted that where tea is a refreshment and hence not essentially a food item, spices are used for seasoning food and again are not essentially a food item. Consequently it can be safely said that spices/condiments and tea are ingredients used for the purpose of refreshment/seasoning etc. the object of both being to make drinkables and eatables more palatable.
Coming now to the most essential feature in the case it would be seen that the logo/design and words used in the wrappers/containers of both the products of the parties is essentially the same. The word ""SHAN"" in yellow letters with red background are common to both the wrappers although the packets vary in size and presentation i.e. the appellant's spices are contained in a card board packet whereas the respondent tea is in a plastic bag. Consequently, taking in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case we are of the firm opinion that indeed the proposed registration of the respondents' trade mark would be in violation of sections 8(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as there is every likelihood of deception and confusion being caused in the minds of the common public regarding the trade mark of the respondent for that of the appellant. Similarly there would be a violation of section 10(1) of the Act as both trade marks are more or less identical.

JOINT REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES---Respondent
","C.O. No. 25683 of 2019, decided on 8th June, 2020.",Nil,"JAWAD HASSAN, J.","the Petitioner No.1 is a private limited company by shares with an authorized share capital of Rs.200,000,000/- divided into 20,000,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.166,580,040/- divided into 16,658,004 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. Similarly, the Petitioner No.2 is a private limited company by share with an authorized share capital of Rs.2,000,000/- divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.600,000/- divided into 60,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. Conversely, the Petitioner No.3 is a private limited company by share with an authorized share capital of Rs.2,000,000/- divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each while its paid-up capital is Rs.600,000/- divided into 60,000 ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each. under unusual conditions.","The basic requirement of Section 279 of the Companies Act is as follows:
(i) there must be a compromise / arrangement/ Scheme
(ii) proposed between a company and its creditors
(iii) application to be made to the Commission now the High Court, as defined above;
(iv) supported by meetings
(v) mandatory filing of material facts relating to the company which is;
(a) financial position
(b) auditor's report
(c) latest accounts of the company
(d) the pendency of any investigation proceedings
(e) supported by the affidavits
Now moving forward, as highlighted above, the expression 'demerger' is not expressly defined in the Companies Act. Sections 279 to 282 of the Companies Act contain provisions regarding Compromises, Arrangement and Reconstruction. However, it could very well be said that the same is covered under the expression arrangement, as defined in subsection (6) of Section 279 of the Companies Act which reads as follows:
"" .the expression ""arrangement"" includes a re-organization of the share-capital of the company by the consolidation of shares of different classes or by the division of shares into shares of different classes or by both those methods, .""
23. Moreover the term demerger has also not been defined in the Indian Companies Act of 2013 which repealed the Companies Act of 1956. However the term demerger finds mention in subsection (19AA) of Section 2 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. According to the said subsection, demerger in relation to companies, means transfer, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.
","Being a sanctioning Court, I have noticed that all indispensable statutory benchmarks, requirements and formalities have been accomplished and adhered to by the petitioners as envisioned under the relevant provisions of the law, including the holding/convening of the requisite meetings as contemplated under the relevant provisions and rules and the resolutions passed by the members have already been highlighted. The scheme set up for sanction has been reinforced and fortified by the requisite majority which decision seems to be just and fair. The report/minutes of meetings unequivocally convey that all essential and fundamental characteristics and attributes of schemes were placed before the voters at the concerned meetings to live up to statutory obligations. The proposed schemes are not found to be violative of any provision of law and/or contrary to public policy but as a whole looks like evenhanded and serviceable from the point of view of a prudent man of business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by him for whom the scheme is meant. As explained in the above case precedents, once the requirements of a scheme for getting sanction of the court are found to have been met, the court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval of the scheme. There does not remain any objection to the scheme of arrangement and no mistake, conspicuous, detectable shortcoming or flaw has further been pointed out in the present matter before me.
36. In view of the forgoing reasons, there remains no impediment to grant and sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the Scheme attached at Annex-A (sic.) is hereby sanctioned in terms thereof.
","Under the Companies Act and the previous Companies Ordinance, 1984 (the ""Ordinance""), the Courts have allowed mergers by stating where all the requisite formalities were complied with including shareholders' approval, the Court would not question the commercial wisdom behind the scheme. One of the effects of the sanction of the Court is that it becomes binding upon the company and its members including those who voted against the scheme once the scheme of compromise and arrangement is approved by statutory majority it binds the dissenting minority and the company. The Court has the power to give effect to all the incidental and ancillary questions in the effort to satisfy itself whether the scheme has the approval of the requisite majority. It is not the function of the Court to examine whether there is a scope for better scheme. However, where the Court finds that scheme is patently fraudulent, it may not respond or function as mere rubber stamp or post office but reject the scheme of arrangement.
30. Furthermore, in the Indian Supreme Court case of Miheer H. Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. reported in AIR 1997 Supreme Court 506, it was held that the court certainly would not act as a court of appeal and sit in judgment over the informed view of the concerned parties to the compromise as the same would be in the realm of corporate and commercial wisdom of the concerned parties. The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the Scheme by the requisite majority. Consequently the Company Court's jurisdiction to that extent is peripheral and supervisory and not appellate.
31. Based on the jurisprudence in Company Law developed by Pakistani, English and Indian cases, discussed above, and in light of the applicable sections of the Companies Act, the Court acts like an umpire in a game of cricket who has to see that both the teams play their game according to the rules and do not overstep the limits. The propriety and the merits of the compromise or arrangement have to be judged by the parties who as sui juris with their open eyes and fully informed about the pros and cons of the Scheme arrive at their own reasoned judgment and agree to be bound by such compromise or arrangement.

","F. No. 336 / SIBA(V)STS / OFT / CCP / 2018, decided on 12th February, 2020.","12th February, 2020.",nil,"The Complainant filed a complaint against the Respondent. The Commission upon receipt of the Complaint initiated an enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act. The principle allegation in the Complaint was that the Respondent is disseminating false and misleading information to consumers through advertisements in various newspapers, claiming to be Testing Service Provider in the name and style of ""Sukkur Testing Service (STS)"", which graphically resembles to the Complainant as ""SIBA Testing Service (STS)"" and consequently damaging the Complainant's reputation, which is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant.
The SCN served to the Respondent was returned undelivered with the remarks of the courier ""Shifted"". The office of Registrar contacted the Respondent telephonically and directed to receive the SCN personally. The Respondent received the SCN and filed written reply on 10th February 2020.  under heightened security.","However based on the submissions raised by the Complainant and the Respondent, we deem it appropriate to address the following issue: Whether the Respondent has resorted to the deceptive marketing practices in violation of section 10 of the Act?","For the reasons discussed above and in line with our mandate to protect the consumers from anti-competitive behavior, including deceptive marketing practices, we hereby hold the subject conduct of the Respondent has violated provisions of section 10(1) of the Act read with section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
38. We are cognizant of the fact that marketers traditionally focus on designing advertising campaigns and other promotional strategies to promote a brand name. However, with evolving consumer preferences and laws, presentation; trade dress have become just as essential for making products and services distinctive and for building brand recall. The cultural diversity of the Pakistan market makes a compelling case for the importance of product identification by packaging and visual impression. This has resulted in third parties creating lookalikes of popular products with similar packaging or offer services through similar logos in order to grab consumers' attention and generate demand for their own products/services in the market. In our considered view, the consumers are clearly susceptible and at a serious risk of falling prey to deceptive confusion pertaining to the origin and quality of the products, due to the striking similarity in the Complainant's logo and the logo used by the Respondent.
39. In the instant matter it is on record that the Respondent had only published one advertisement i.e. the Impugned Advertisement, the last date to file application thereof was 26th November 2018. Thereafter, no further advertisements were issued by the Respondent. The Complaint was filed on 28th January 2019 and in the Enquiry Report it is also acknowledged that no other advertisement was published by the Respondent. It is on the record that the proprietor of Respondent discontinued the business through Respondent. The Respondent after the hearing in the matter has also submitted its Bank statement for the period 27th June 2018 to 12th February 2020 titled Sukkur Testing Services (SMC-PVT) Limited at Habib Bank Branch G-10 Markaz, Islamabad. From examination of advertisement and bank statement it is evident the advertisement was published in the newspapers on November 2018 and the last date of forms submission of fee was 26th November 2018. The Respondent received the fee amounting to Rs. 50, 150, 250, 300 and 450 from students for seven different posts mentioned in the advertisement. Till 26th November 2018 its account balance was Rs. 556,140.00/, The Respondent has clarified that the amount of Rs. 500,000/- (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) was returned to the Public Sector Organization and the Bank Statement shows the withdrawal of the said amount also. During the hearing the Respondent had also submitted that he is willing to comply with the directions and he will not indulge in any illegal practices in future. It is also relevant that Complainant though had claimed during the hearing that prospective consumers approached them, however, no evidence in this regard was produced before us. Further, even in the Complaint's paras (5) and (6) there is no mention that the prospective candidates approached them upon seeing the advertisement.
40. Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Act, however, the approach of the representative of the Respondent needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and the Respondent discontinued the violation during the enquiry and never repeated that violation of the Act. In addition he also apologized and assured future compliance of the Act in letter and spirit. We, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 250,000/- (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, given Respondent is directed to deposit the penalty with the Commission in two equal instalments within ninety (90) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is also reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Act.
41. In terms of the above, the Show Cause Notice No. 01 of 2020 dated 17th January 2020 is hereby disposed of.
","The concept of Consumer vis- -vis section 10 of the Act: It is clear that under the Act, the Commission is mandated to protect the consumers from anti-competitive practices prohibited. One of such practice is deceptive marketing practices, which is aimed at the consumers to make a transactional decision, Hence, it is important to determine the consumer for the purpose of assessment under section 10 of the Act. 
The concept of False or Misleading information in the process of advertising/marketing: Subsequent to understanding and clarifying the concept of Consumer, we are of the considered opinion that, it must be understood, what constitutes 'false' or 'misleading' information in the process of advertising/marketing which evokes a violation of section 10 of the Act. 
Net General Impression of the Impugned Advertisement: The third and most important aspect in order to record our findings vis-a-vis the violation of prohibition contained in section 10 of the Act, is to gather the impression of the advertisement/marketing campaign impugned. The Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e. Order in the matter of China Mobile Pak Limited and Pakistan Telecom Mobile Limited reported as 2010 CLD 1478, has held that:
""...evaluate complete advertisement and make an opinion regarding deception [...] on the basis of net general impression conveyed by them and not an isolated script"".
Material Information: With reference to the materiality of the representation, reference can be made to the FTC Policy Statement on Deception dated 14.10.1983 appended to Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 174 (1984), wherein it is provided that the commission, omission, or practice must be a 'material' one which is likely to affect the consumer's conduct or decision with regard to a product or service. This was also endorsed by the Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e., Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zone and Ufone reported as 2010 CLD 1478.
28. We take into account the overall net general impression of the Impugned Advertisement, we cannot ignore the fact that similar acronym used by the Respondent might confuse the Consumers/ prospective candidates about the goodwill and status of the Testing Service. Hence, we are of the opinion that the Respondent by using the similar acronym is in fact passing off its services and misleading the consumers about its association with the Complainant.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, using of similar acronym by the Respondent gives the Consumers an impression that either the Impugned Advertisement is issued by the Complainant or the Respondent is somehow associated or affiliated with the Complainant. Further, the word `Sukkur' also can confuse the consumers about the information disseminated through the Impugned Advertisement that the services being offered to attract prospective candidates are by the Complainant. In response we note that the Respondent has not provided any evidence which substantiate that the Respondent is associated with the Complainant. Further, the use of similar acronym and words Sukkur in the Impugned Advertisement seems to be a conscious attempt by the Respondent to capitalize on the goodwill and standing of the Complainant. Hence, we are of the considered view that in the instant matter a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(b) is made out.
31. Fraudulent Use of Trademark: With reference to the fraudulent use of trademark, it is on the record that the Complainant had applied for registration of trademark in the name and style of ""SIBA Testing Services"" vide application dated 22nd February, 2019 i.e. even after filing the Complaint with the Commission. We are also conscious of the fact that the trademark is not registered in favour of any of the parties. Although the Complainant, from the material available on the record, is a prior user; however, the ownership is yet to be conferred by the Trademarks Registry under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
We are cognizant of the fact that the scope of proceedings under section 10 of the Act is restricted only to the extent of deceptive marketing practices. We are not conferred with the power by the legislature to determine the right to ownership of any undertakings vis- -vis the trademark. The assessment in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act i.e. fraudulent use of another's trademark, can only be carried out where the ownership is granted or acquired under any law i.e. the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, a similar situation exists in the instant matter, as the trademark is not registered in the name of either party, hence, any findings vis-a-vis the ownership of the trademark would be beyond the scope of section 10 of the Act and would be construed as encroaching upon the domain of Trademark Registrar under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, we are of the considered view that a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act cannot be proved in the instant matter.
. Information Capable of Harming the Business Interest of other undertakings: Now turning to section 10(2)(a) of the Act, according to which 'the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. We are guided by one of Commission's earlier Order i.e. Order dated 21st December, 2012 in the matter of Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd, 2013 CLD 1014, wherein the Commission had observed that ""it is important to recognize that part of any business' identity is the goodwill it has established with consumers, while part of a product's identity is the reputation it has earned for quality and value"". We are also guide by, Order dated 17 March 2015 in the matter of M/S Jotun Pakistan (Pvt) Limited, 2015 CLD 1638, the Commission had held that ""To prove conduct under section 10(2)(a) of the Act, it is not necessary to show actual harm to competitors. It is sufficient to show the existence of a deceptive marketing practice that has the potential to harm the business interests of the competitors."" (emphasis added).
It is also pertinent to mention that in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act read with 10(2)(b) or (c) or (d) of the Act, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out. The consequence of the distribution of information to the public that is false or misleading is that it is capable of harming the business interests of and resulting in fatal consequences for the competitors of the undertaking making such deceptive claims. It may also be clarified at this point that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than the other sub-sections of section 10(2). It was observed by the Commission in its Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs A. Rahim Foods {Private) Limited, 2016 CLD 1128, that ""While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section I0(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise"". The same rationale is applicable to Section 10(2)(b) of the Act, as it is to section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

Moreover, the pendency of the application of defendant No.2 for registration of his mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks will not disentitle the plaintiff being proprietor of a registered trade mark from his exclusive right to its use and that such right will be deemed to be infringed by any person who uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling to as it likely to deceive or cause confusion in view of sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance. I have gone through the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the defendants and I am of the view that the same on being distinguishable facts and law do not advance the case of the defendants. I, therefore, allow C.M.A. No. 5628 of 2020, as prayed. Consequently, C.M.A. No. 9830 of 2020 stands dismissed on being infructuous.","It appears from the pleadings of the parties that the plaintiff claims to have launched Baroque's first showroom in Karachi in the year 2007 and secured the said brand and the interests associated with it by registering it with the name of ""'Baroque"" with the Trademark Registry at Karachi in the relevant Classes 20, 24 to 27, 35, 37 and 42 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, in February, 2016 and also got it registered as a copyright since January, 2017 under the category of ""Artistic Work"" (label design) with the Intellectual Property Organization of Pakistan, Copyright office, Karachi bearing registration No. 35172-Copr. It is also claim of the plaintiff that even prior to the registration of the ""Baroque Inc."" trademark and copyright, the plaintiff's rights in the use of mark ""Baroque"" were protected under the law of passing off in view of the use of the mark by her since the year 2001. Trademark Registration Certificates are annexed with the memo of plaint as annexure ""E/1"" to ""E/1"" at page 133 to 147 and Certificate of Registration of Copyright in the artistic work (label design) Baroque is annexed as annexure ""F"" at page 149. It has been observed in the case of Messrs Dewan (supra) by this Court that once a trademark is registered under the provisions of Ordinance, 2001 it restricts the other parties from using such trade mark. 
it may be observed that the plaintiff's trademark is admittedly registered under Classes 25 and 26 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, which are related to wearing apparel, clothing etc. and fabric and furniture trimmings and the defendant No.2 is admittedly offering his goods/ wearing apparel and clothing, which being falling under the Class 25 are identical with the name of BAROQUE and the consumer served are of the same category, as such, the features of defendants' goods do make out a case of there being likelihood of confusion or deception with regard to their source",KMZ/M-13/Sindh Application allowed.,Allowed

","High Court Appeal No. 170 of 2003, decided on 18th May, 2004.",,,"Through these proceedings, the appellants have impugned order dated 23-5-2004 passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit No.677 of 2001, filed by the respondent, allowing the injunction application of the respondent observing therein that the respondent in terms of section 21 of the Trade Marks Act have right to use the Trade Mark which is subject-matter of this appeal, to the exclusion of the appellants.
The facts, as it appear from the pleadings of the parties are that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court for infringement of trade mark, passing off, perpetual injunction, rendition of accounts and damages against the appellants. Alongwith the suit, the respondent made an application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. praying therein that the appellants be restrained from infringing the alleged trade mark and from passing off the goods. It appears that the matter was contested by the parties before the learned Single Judge who by his order, impugned in these proceedings, had allowed the application of the respondent restraining the appellants from infringing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, supplying, distributing or otherwise passing off the goods under the alleged trade mark `ALETRIS CORDIAL'.
 with an additional plaintiff.","Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the impugned order is bad in law and has failed to take notices' of the facts in its true perspective. He has further argued that the respondent had no prima facie case and were not entitled to the grant of injunction. According to the learned counsel once title in question of the trademark of a party was in dispute, the Court would riot grant injunction in favour of such a party. 
As against this, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge.","We fully endorse the findings of the Honourable Single Judge given in the impugned order while granting injunction. This Appeal is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs. However, office is directed to fix Suit No.677 of 2001 for settlement of issues within fifteen days and after the issues are settled the matter be listed for evidence, out of turn within 3 months after framing of issues.
 

 
","From the pleadings of the parties it appears that the respondent filed Suit No.677 of 2001 in this Court against the appellants claiming to be a Private Limited Company doing its business of medicines since 1948. In the plaint, the respondent has pleaded that besides the other, medicines of various brands, which the respondent was manufacturing and selling, the respondent claims to be registered proprietor of trade mark ""ALTERIS CORDIAL'. The respondent subsequently applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks to enter its name in the Register of Trade mark as subsequent proprietor of the said trade mark, which application was allowed and the respondent became subsequent proprietor of the trade mark. According to the respondent the homeopathic medicine by the name of `ALETRIS CORDIAL' under the said trade mark on the device of the bottle in the hand, with distinctive, get up, design and yellow and black colour scheme, due to its high quality gained popularity and was in great demand and, therefore, the respondent got valuable reputation and goodwill in respect of the said medicine in the market.
 
In the year 1998 the respondent came to know that the appellant No. 1 had applied and got registered the label of the respondent said registered trademark in the office of Registrar of Copyright as artistic copyright work label created by him. The respondent made an application for rectification under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, before the Board which application was allowed against which the appellants preferred an appeal which appeal is pending in the Lahore High Court. According to the respondent the appellant No. 1 is manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale his spurious medicine in the trade mark registered in the name of the respondent with the same colour, scheme, get up, design and style. The respondent has disputed the ownership of the Trade mark of the appellant No.1. The appellants in rebuttal filed Counter-Affidavit and Written Statement. It appears that the Honourable Single Judge heard the matter at length and thereafter has passed the impugned order with detail reasons.
 
The impugned order has been passed on an interlocutory application and the learned counsel for the appellants had argued that the grant of injunction when the damages were also claimed, ex-facie was erroneous order. If such an argument is accepted, the usurping of goodwill of the trade mark by the appellants who, prima facie, have no right under the Copyrights Ordinance, 1962, would be unjust as has been held in the case of TAPAL Tea (Private) Ltd. v. Shahi Tea Company reported in 2002 CLD 1113. Pendency of proceedings in appeal preferred by the appellants against the order of the Board, is hardly a ground restricting the Court from granting injunction if a party was otherwise, entitled to such an injunction. Even otherwise, a person, prima facie, having no legal right, guaranteed in law, could not be allowed to continue his business in the face of the reasons advanced by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order. The impugned order has been passed on the material placed before the Honourable Single Judge and we find no reason to upset it. However, the appellants are at liberty to lead evidence to establish their legal right to do the business. The Honourable Single Judge has already observed in the impugned order that his findings were tentative in nature and is subject to evidence, which the parties may lead in support of their pleas. Even observations in the impugned order were held to be tentative and would not prejudice either party before the Registrar, Trade marks or before any forum.",S.A.K./R-11/K Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE ISSUED TO MESSRS SOCIETY OF ACCOUNTING EDUCATION FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES:
"," In the matter of
File No. 185/OFT/CFA/CCP/2015, decided on 14th December, 2016.",,,"The Complainant is a non-stock corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, United States of America. The company is engaged in imparting education and training to students and professionals in the field of investment and financial analysis and has gradually extended its operations around the world, including Pakistan. The Respondent is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 of Pakistan and is engaged in the provision of educational services in the field of finance and accounting. Both are undertaking in terms of section 2(1)(q) of the Act.
3. The Complainant has alleged that the Respondent has been using the Complainant's registered Trademark 'CFA' to deceive public and promote its business. It further alleged that the Respondent had resorted to the dissemination of false or misleading information, which is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant. Moreover, it alleged that the Respondent had been distributing false or misleading information by unauthorized use of imitated marks as CFA, ACFA, FCFA, DCFA, as if the Respondent was authorized/permitted by the Complainant to use the mark 'CFA' by the Complainant as such.
4. An enquiry in terms of section 37(2) of the Act was initiated in the matter, which was concluded vide an enquiry report dated 04 March 2015 (the 'Enquiry Report').
After considering the Enquiry Report, the Commission issued the SCN to the Respondent, wherein it was required to respond in writing within fourteen (14) days as well as to appear before Commission on 02 June 2015. The relevant parts of the SCN are reproduced hereinbelow:
""AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, it appears that the Undertaking began using the Impugned Mark, and variations of it, in relation to its own educational enterprise in 2010, without the Complainant's authorization;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 19 in particular, the Complainant sent the Undertaking cease and desist letters in February 2011, in response to which the Respondent modified its website and eliminated references to be Impugned Mark for a certain time period;
AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraph 6 in particular, the Undertaking resumed its use of the Impugned Mark and its variations in 2012 which continued until the time of the complaint in 2013;
8. AND WHEREAS, in terms of the Enquiry Report in general and paragraphs 6, 22 and 23 in particular, while it appears that the Undertaking has now modified the mark depicted on its website, it remains misleadingly similar to the Impugned Mark;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that through the use of the Impugned Mark and deceptively similar variations of the same, the Undertaking is prima facie distributing false and misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of the Complainant, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(a) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, the Undertaking is involved in providing and advertising its services through the use of the Impugned Mark which prima facie amounts to distributing false and misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use, or quality of goods, which constitutes a prima facie violation of section 10(2)(b) of the Act;
AND WHEREAS, it appears that the Undertaking's use of the Complainant's Impugned Mark prima facie amounts to fraudulent use of another's trademark, which constitutes a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act.""
 with new evidence presented.","The following issues have been identified for deliberation and decision:
a) Whether or not the presence of a suit for permanent injunction against infringement of trademarks bars the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Act and hence the proceedings?
b) Whether or not the alleged advertisements, marketing material, and trademarks used by the Respondent constitute deceptive marketing practices in terms of section 10 of the Act?
","The Commission hereby directs the Respondent to immediately cease the use of the mark 'CFA' in any form whatsoever.
The Respondent is further directed to cease the use of terms 'DCFA, ACFA, FCFA, and CFAs.' or any other similar acronyms and terms, in any form and to amend its promotional and marketing material accordingly.
Furthermore, the Respondent is directed to amend its Article and Memorandum of Association to remove any reference to the abovementioned terms.
For each of the four violations stated above, a penalty of PKR 0.5 million is imposed on the Respondent for a total of PKR 2 million.
The Respondent is also directed to file a compliance report with the Registrar to the Commission within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of this order and is reprimanded from indulging in deceptive marketing practices in future as at the risk of severe penal consequences.
The penalties and direction hereinabove have been imposed after taking into account the seriousness and length of the violations and its impact on the consumers and the interests of the competing undertakings, and are proportionate to the contraventions of section 10 of the Act and necessary to restore the fair competition in the relevant market.
In terms of the above, SCN No.01/2015 is hereby disposed of.

","With respect to the first issue, it is clarified that the subject proceedings before the Commission do not have any nexus with the suit proceedings pending before the learned Additional District and Session Judge as highlighted by the Respondent. It has been observed by Commission in its Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to M/s. Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for Deceptive Marketing Practices that the pendency of a civil suit or principle of ""res sub judice"" as enunciated in section 10 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (the 'C.P.C.') has no relevance to Commission's proceedings under the Act. The relevant part of the order is as follow:
""Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of 'res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision, as explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits' pending in 'courts'.
Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi- judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'court' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court.""
Based on the above, a suit for a permanent injunction regarding infringement of trademarks is a different subject than the one being considered by the Commission i.e. whether or not the Respondent has engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the Complainants trademark for the purpose of misleading consumers and distorting competition.

With respect to the second issue the Complainant has submitted documentary evidence of its 'applications of registration' and 'registration of Trade Mark' in the Trademark under TR No's. 196401, 196402, 136436 and 964000 which establishes the Complainant's exclusive right to mark CFA denoting Chartered Financial Analyst. The Respondent has used different advertising schemes by using the mark CFA for the promotion of its institute/courses, which has never been contested by the Respondent, both during the enquiry and the proceedings.
The Commission directed the Respondent in hearing on 2 June 2015 to submit its Memorandum and Article of Association. Upon analyzing the Memorandum and Article of Association. the following references relevant to the matter at hand were found:
a. The clause (i) of section 4 of Memorandum of Association of the Respondent states, ""the Society will award the membership as Certified Financial Accountants (CFA) and its associates and fellowship"".
b. The interpretation clause (1) of section 1 of Article of Association states, ""Profession means the profession of the business of Certified Financial Accountants (CFA)"".
19. It is also pertinent to mention here that Respondent on receiving the cease and desist letters on 21 March 2011 from Complainant, changed the designatory letters from CFA to CFAc in August 2013 for its Certified Financial Accountants program.
20. The above claims and the evidence available on the record clearly establish that the Respondent used the registered trademark of the Complainant i.e., CFA in its marketing and other materials. The images retrieved from the Respondent's website, the advertisements in newspapers, the evidence or record substantiate Complainant's assertions.
With regard to contravention of Section 10 of the Act, it is noted that the Commission in its Order In The Matter Of Show Cause Notices Issued to Paint Manufacturers (Taint Order') has observed that:
""...for the purposes of deceptive Marketing, actual deception need not be shown to carry the burden of proof it is sufficient to establish that the advertisement has the tendency to deceive and capacity to mislead.""
Furthermore, the Commission has observed in its Order In The Matter Of Complaint filed by Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd.
""It is a cardinal principle of law and fair commercial trading, that deceptive measures should not be adopted to adversely effect goodwill will and recognition earned by other organization. The only reason for such conduct is to gain an advantage on the goodwill attached to the Complainant's trademark, which is indeed capable of harming Complainant 's business interest...""
For the above reasons, in order to constitute a violation of section 10, the marketing and advertising must have the ability to deceive. 
Furthermore, in relation to section 10(2)(d) of the Act, the principle, the Commission has established the fraudulent use is not the ""subjective intent"" but the ""objective manifestation"" of that intent. 
In view of the above, the usage of the Complaints trademark 'CFA' amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information by the Respondent capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(a) of the Act. At the same time, as discussed above, the usage of the trademark also amounts to the dissemination of false and misleading information to consumers in violation of section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(b) of the Act.
The marks used by the Respondent FCFA, DCFA, ACFA and CFAc, containing the words ""F"", ""D"", ""A"" and ""Ac"" stand respectively for Fellow, Diploma, Associate, and Accountants. Therefore the words ""F"", ""D"" and ""A"" used in the Complainant's trademark 'CFA' connote the idea that these courses are offered by the Complainant. An ordinary consumer i.e., the students of accounting and finance who would join the world renowned institute of complainant i.e., CFA, would likely be misled by these words and connotations and is highly likely to consider the Respondents institute as authorized by the Complainant. This is based on fact and the Commission's earlier decisions quoted above that the ordinary consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyze it minutely. In similar vein, the use of the letter `c' in minuscule Form with the registered trademark of the Complainant is capable of misleading the ordinary consumer.
In view of the above, the Commission holds that by using the above-noted variation of the 'CFA' the Respondent has violated section 10(1) read with section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

That in order to secure the proprietary rights in the said cartoon character, plaintiffs No.2 had filed applications for registration of copyright therein with the Copy Right Registry on 07.07.2011 on the basis of such longstanding use, to which none had filed any opposition or objections. That the plaintiffs came to know through the internet that the defendant in order to deceive and cause confusion amongst the buyers is displaying, uploading and offering for sale the same cartoon character and its various forms/modes through internet website www.fotolia.com. Plaintiffs thereafter issued legal notices to the defendant on 25.04.2011 and subsequently on 25.08.2011 requiring him to stop. The plaintiffs also complained the matter with the copyrights agent of Fotolia website and demanded the said website to expeditiously remove or disable access to such contents illegally displayed, offered for sale or free downloads and as a result of the notice dated 26.04.2011, Fotolia immediately removed the said cartoon character from its website. The matter came up in the Court on 09.02.2012, when notices were ordered to be issued to the defendant. Thereafter, office has issued summons to the defendant, which returned with an endorsement that defendant refused to accept it. Vakalatnama was filed by Khawaja Muhammad Azeem on behalf of the said defendant on 05.11.2012, therefore, the matter was taken up by the A.R (O.S) for filing of written statement by the defendant on 30.04.2013, 10.09.2013 and 28.01.2014 however none appeared on his behalf, hence A.R (O.S) debarred the defendant vide diary dated 18.02.2014. On 05.12.2014, the matter was fixed for final disposal and the plaintiffs were directed to file affidavit-in-ex-parte proof, which was filed accordingly. Plaintiffs filed application under Order XIII, rule 2, C.P.C. seeking permission for production of copyright registration certificate bearing Registration Nos.26519-Corp to 26532-Corp and Nos.26587-Corp to 26606-Corp (total 34 in number) dated 31.07.2012, which was allowed vide order dated 18.10.2017 and the plaintiffs were directed to file additional affidavit-in-evidence for exhibiting all the above mentioned registration certificates, which were filed accordingly and vide order dated 29.10.2018 office was directed to attach the same with the affidavit-in-ex parte proof and the matter was fixed for evidence. On 02.12.2019 he was again examined on additional affidavit-in-ex-parte proof and the matter was directed to be fixed for final arguments. with contradictory witness statements.","Issues posed through this Suit could be summarized as under:-
1. Whether there is copyright in a cartoon character?
2. Whether the plaintiffs had copyright in the said cartoon character?
3. Has the defendant infringed plaintiffs' copyright in the said cartoon character?
4. What the decree should be?

","Conclusion of the issue 1 discussion leads to the answering of this issue in the affirmative.
Residual effect of the above discussion is that the Plaintiffs have copyright in the said cartoon character, hence issue No.2 is answered in the affirmative.
Resultantly Issue No. 3 is answered in affirmative as there is no cavil that the defendant left any stone unturned to infringe the plaintiffs' copyrighted work and scheme of law fully supports the case of the plaintiffs.
With regard issue No.4, this Court reached to the conclusion that the plaintiffs were able to prove their case against the defendant.","Issues No.1 is heart of the matter which is primarily a legal issue regarding copyrightability of cartoon characters. It is worth noting that one of the most well-known cartoon charter of our times is Mickey Mouse (an animated mouse) which was originally created in October 1928. With regards infringement of cartoon characters, courts usually rely on the copyright protection in the original work, as it is usually difficult to copy a character without copying a substantial amount of the original author's expression. The 'substantial similarity test' is used for determining when enough has been taken from the original work so as to constitute infringement. The first step of the proposed test is whether a character is a general type, i.e. an idea, or whether the character is developed enough to constitute protectable expression. This part of the test is only a way of eliminating characters that are obviously of a general type with little expression so that a lengthy analysis would be unnecessary. The second part of the test is to apply the extrinsic/intrinsic test articulated in Krofft to determine if a character is protected by copyright within the context of the original work.""
the witness of the Plaintiffs has submitted a number of registration certificates of the said cartoon character as Exhibit P-1/76 to P-1/109 issued by the Copyright Registry proving that the said work after going through the scrutiny of the Copyright Ordinance and its Rules has already been registered as Artistic Work. The said witness also produced advertisement of plaintiffs cartoon character published in newspaper and magazines as Exhibits PW-1/12 to PW-1/30 and certified copies of the Copyright applications and their advertisements in the newspaper as Exhibit PW-1/31 to PW-1/65
To prove Issue No.2 as to the ownership of copyright in the work, the Plaintiff's witness namely Mr. Abdullah Feroz produced Copyright Registration Certificates Nos.26519-Corp to 26532-Corp and Nos.26587-Corp to 26606-Corp (total 34 in number) dated 31.07.2012 as Exhibit P-1/76 to P-1/109 issued by the Copyright Registry proving registration of the said artistic work with the Copyright Registry.
Section 42(2) titled ""Register of Copyrights to be prima facie evidence of particulars entered therein"" provides that a certificate of registration of copyright in a work shall be prima facie evidence that copyright subsists in the work and that the person shown in the certificate as the owner of the copyright is the owner of such copyright.
To prove issue No.3, the Plaintiffs' witness produced on record Appointment letter dated 01.09.2004 showing that the defendant was employed as Graphic Designer in Plaintiffs' company and affidavit/undertaking of Surrender and Non-Disclosure as Exhibits PW-1/10 and PW-1/11 are also on record.
The ""substantial similarity test"" is used for determining when enough has been taken from the original work so as to constitute infringement. The first step of the proposed test is whether a character is a general type, i.e. an idea, or whether the character is developed enough to constitute protectable expression. The second part of the test is to apply the extrinsic/intrinsic test articulated in Krofft7 to determine if a character is protected by copyright within the context of the original work.

","13th March, 3rd and 22nd April, 2019.",Nil,"The Complainant in its complaint stated that its business ""Dar-e-Arqam School"" is presently known as one of the best quality education service provider in Pakistan, for which the Complainant converted his partnership business into private limited company named as ""Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited in year 2009. The Complainant initially entered into franchise agreements with the Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 which were later expired or terminated by the Complainant and no agreement was ever signed with Respondent No. 6. Furthermore, the Respondent No. 7 started their campuses with the name similar to the project name of the Complainant i.e. Tarbiyah which was brainchild of the Complainant and it was introduced in 2014 under Total Child Development Plan (TCDP). The use of Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and deceptive use of Complainant's project name ""Tarbiyah"" by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8 without any due authorization, constitutes, prima facie, violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, acts of the Respondents are not only misleading the consumers about their services but are also capable of harming business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act. under different legal circumstances.","It is evident that the use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 and the deceptive use of the Complainant's project name i.e; Tarbiyah, by Respondents Nos. 7 and 8, is without any due authorization, thereby in violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(d) of the Act. Moreover, it also appears that the act of the Respondents Nos.1 to 8 is not only misleading the consumers regarding their products but it is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant, in violation of section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
5.2 The deceptive marketing practices have a direct impact on the public at large and therefore, it is in the interest of the general public and fair competition in the market that the undertakings should be stopped from marketing their products in an unfair and misleading manner and be encouraged to resort to marketing practices which are transparent and give consumers true and correct information.
5.3 Therefore, in light of the above mentioned findings, it is recommended that show cause notices may be issued to Respondents Nos. 1 to 8 for, prima facie, violation of section 10(1), in terms of section 10(2)(a)(b) and (d) of the Act.""
Based on the material available on the record i.e. the Enquiry Report, SCN and the written replies filed by the Respondents following issue arise for determination:
(i) Whether the Complaint is instituted in accordance with the law?
(ii) Whether can Commission can proceed in the matter while there is pending civil/criminal litigation between the parties at various forums?
(iii) Whether the enquiry committee proceeded with mala fide intentions and conclusion of the Enquiry Report is biased?
(iv) Whether the Respondent has violated the provisions of section 10 of the Act?

","As noted in the preceding paragraphs, it is established that the Respondents have engaged in deceptive marketing practices prohibited under section 10(2)(a), (b) and (d) read with section 10(1) of the Act. Therefore, for reasons mentioned in preceding paragraph we deem it appropriate to impose a penalty in the amount of PKR 5,000,000 (Rupees Five Million Only) on the proprietor of the Respondent institutions, collectively. In addition to the foregoing, we cannot ignore the fact, which though is discussed in Paras 6 and 7 above, however, we deems it appropriate to refer to it again that the Respondents from the first date showed reluctance in making submissions before us and got an adjournment on one pretext or the other. On the first date of hearing, despite receipt of notice much in advance, an adjournment was requested to file written reply. On the second hearing, i.e. 03rd April 2019, the authorized representative again requested for adjournment. Subsequently hearing was scheduled for 22nd April 2019 and on the said date, despite service and receipt of the notice neither anyone appeared on behalf of the Respondents nor was any written request made on their behalf or by them. Therefore, we decided to proceed ex-parte against the Respondents on 22nd April 2019 in accordance with provision to subsection (2) of section 30 of the Act read with clause (e) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 26 of the in the matter pursuant to Regulation 26(2)(e) of Competition Commission (General Enforcement) Regulations, 2007. The foregoing attitude of delaying tactics falls squarely within the purview of clause (e) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act i.e. knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the process of the Commission to conclude the proceedings. Accordingly, in pursuance of clause (c) of subsection (2) of section 38 of the Act, we are constrained to impose a further penalty of PKR 500,000/-(Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) on the proprietor of the Respondents for knowingly abusing, impeding and obstructing the proceedings before us. The proprietor of the Respondent Institutions are directed to deposit the imposed penalty with the Registrar of the Commission, within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this order.
The Proprietor of the Respondent Institutions is also directed to publish in atleast two national daily newspapers that they have no affiliation or association with the Complainant within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of this Order and to refrain from indulging in any form of deceptive marketing practices in the future and is forewarned that repeat violations may attract further stricter penalties as per the law.","The Respondents have made the submission through their written reply that filing/institution of the Complaint is questionable due to the fact that Mr. Bajwa's Breach of his affidavit as an Advocate. Although the ground raised by the Respondents is not clear, however, given the challenge made to the validity of the complaint under the provisions of the Act, we deem it appropriate to address the issue at hand. The complaint for violation of any provisions of the Act can be filed under section 37(2) of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
Section 37(2) where the Commission received from an undertaking or a registered association of consumers in writing of such facts as appear to constitute a contravention of the provision of Chapter II, it shall, unless it is of opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or is not substantiated by prima facie evidence conduct an enquiry into the matter to which the complaint relates.
23. The Legal Advisor in attendance referred to the earlier Orders In the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Kamyu.Pk reported as 2018 CLD 919, wherein while interpreting the provisions of section 37(2) and validity of the complaint observed as follows:
10. In the instant matter the proceedings were initiated on a complaint filed by Mr. Umair Ali through email dated 30th April 2015. Further perusal of the contents of the Complaint reveals that the Complainant had approached the Commission as a consumer and not as an undertaking. The competent authority also initiated the enquiry on the aforesaid complaint under section 37(2) of the Act. It needs to be appreciated that the Commission is not empowered under section 37(2) of the Act to proceed with an enquiry on the complaint of the consumer, rather, the legislature in all its wisdom has categorically outlined that the complaint is to be filed either by the 'undertaking' or 'registered association of consumers'. Before proceeding further it is relevant to refer to the definition of 'undertaking' as provided under clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, which for ease of reference is reproduced herein below:
(q) ""undertaking"" means any natural or legal person, governmental body including a regulatory authority, body corporate, partnership, association, trust or other entity in any way engaged, directly or indirectly, in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services and shall include an association or undertakings;
11. The Commission in one of its recent Orders i.e. Order dated 15th December 2017 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Utility Stores Corporation of Pakistan (Private) Limited has defined the term 'undertaking', in the following manner:
""29. A bare perusal of the definition of an undertaking' leaves no doubt that it is divided in two parts. The first part of the definition takes within its folds the types of entities that can possibly exist i.e. an individual, a company, a firm, an association of undertakings, governmental entities, sector-regulators, a body corporate established under the Provincials or the Federal laws of Pakistan, a cooperative society and any other entity regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. Whereas the second part focuses on the nature of activity which is performed by them be it directly or indirectly i.e. production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services. The most important part of the second limb of the definition is that the legislature within its wisdom by using the words 'in any way' (emphasis added), has made it clear that there is no condition on the legal entity to engage in commercial or economic activity to fall within the purview of 'undertaking' for the purposes of the Act. If any legal entity or natural person is engaged in any way in the production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services, the said undertaking would fall within the purview of the term `undertaking'.""
12. We are cognizant of the fact that nowhere in the definition of `undertaking' the word 'consumer' is used. Upon analysis it is noticed that the term 'consumer' though is not defined under the Act, has been used in various other provisions, the instances are as follows:
a) In clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'dominant position',
b) In clause (k) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act in the definition of 'relevant market',
c) In clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Act outlining the criteria for grant of exemptions,
d) In clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act, in the instance of deceptive marketing practices.
13. There is no doubt that apart from providing for free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity and to enhance economic efficiency, the scope of the Act is also to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices, which inter alia include the deceptive marketing practices. Although the term 'consumer' is not defined in the Act, however, in other consumer protection laws the term has been defined. It has been held by the august Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Muhammad Hussain Patel v. Habib Wali Muhammad, PLD 1981 SC 1, that definition from other statute can only be borrowed from other statutes where both the statutes are pari materia. The question is when statutes are considered pari materia, in this regard we draw guidance from the judgment of Honorable Sindh High Court reported as Murtaza Flour Mills (Private) Limited v. Federation of Pakistan and others, 1996 MLD 1273, wherein the Honourable Court has held:
...[s]tatutes in pari materia are statutes which are so related as to form a system or code of legislation and when they relate to same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things or have the same purpose or object it is only then that the statutes are called in pari material...
14. Keeping in view the above approach in mind, the consumer protections laws are framed to protect the interests of the consumers. Similarly, the Act also provides for protection of consumers, hence, we are of the considered view that the definition of 'consumer' can be borrowed from the consumer protection legislation inforce. The definitions are as follows:
(i) Subsection (3) of section 2 of the Islamabad Consumer Protection Act, 1995 has defined the 'consumer' in the following terms:
(3) ""consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment or hire purchase and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(ii) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(c) ""consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtains on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any services for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services;
(iii) Clause (e) of section 2 of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2014 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means a person or entity who:
(i) buys or obtain on lease any product for a consideration and includes any user of such product but does not include a person who obtains any product for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any service for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services,
(iv) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997 has defined the consumers in the following terms:
(c) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or to promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
(v) Clause (c) of section 2 of the Balochistan Consumers Protection Act, 2003 has defined the consumer in the following terms:
(e) ""Consumer"" means any person who:
(i) buys goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised' to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire. Purchase and leasing and includes any user of such goods but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires any goods or services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised to be paid or under any system of deferred payment including hire purchase and leasing and includes any beneficiary of such services.
. It is clear from the facts available on the record that the Complainant was a consumer and the complaint was not filed on behalf of any registered association of the consumers. Since, a consumer does not fall within the purview of the definition of 'undertaking', hence, we hereby conclude that the initiation of the enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act on the basis of the complaint in question was in fact violative of the express provisions of law. We note that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint filed with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. In this regard reference is made to National Feeds Limited v. Competition Commission of Pakistan, 2016 CLD 1688.
24. In the aforesaid Order Re: Kamyu.Pk the Commission has clarified that who can file a complaint with the Commission under section 37(2) of the Act. In the instant matter, the complaint was filed under section 37(2) of the Act by Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation through one of its Director namely Mr. Akhter Bajwa and a Board Resolution as well as the Authority letter in favour of Mr. Akhter Bajwa was filed along with the Complaint. The Respondents have raised no objection on the authorization, rather an allegation has been levelled that Mr. Bajwa being an Advocate cannot do any other business. The Legal Advisor to the Commission has also highlighted that the current proceedings before this Bench pertains to violation of section 10 of the Act and the Commission and this Bench is not an appropriate authority to take any action against Mr. Bajwa in terms of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.
25. After carefully reviewing the merits and the submissions made before us vis- -vis the first issues, we agree with the submissions made by the Legal Advisor in attendance and re-emphasise that for initiation of the enquiry any complaint fled with the Commission must satisfy the criteria laid down in the express provision of law, i.e. it must be filed by an 'undertaking' or 'a registered association of consumers' and must be substantiated with prima facie evidence, failing which no enquiry thereon can be conducted. The instant complaint was filed by the Messrs Dar-e-Arqam Schools (Pvt.) Limited and Dar-e-Arqam Foundation are unquestionably an 'undertaking' in terms of clause (q) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act, through its' duly authorized representative and no objection on the authority so bestowed upon Mr. Bajwa has been called into question. Instead, allegations against Mr. Bajwa has been made for violating the affidavit and the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973. 
We now proceed to address the issue No. (ii), in the matter based on the record available. There are several ongoing civil suits which primarily tempted the Respondents to raise this objection in the instant proceedings.
i. Respondent's suit in Rawalpindi,
ii. Respondent's suit in Peshawar,
iii. Respondent's suit in Islamabad,
iv. Respondent has field a revision petition before the High Court,
v. Complainant has filed a suit in the court of Intellectual Property Tribunal.
27. Mr. Farooqi while addressing this aspect has placed reliance and referred to an earlier Order passed by the Commission In the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs Tara Crop Sciences (Private) Limited for deceptive marketing practices, reported as 2016 CLD 105, wherein it was observed as follows:
""15. We find this argument to be without merit. Section 10 of the C.P.C. does indeed prohibit the generation of multiple claims pertaining to the same subject matter before different forums, and enunciates the principle of `res sub judice '. The purpose behind the provision. As explained through case-law, has been to avoid conflicting judgments and wastage of resources. Section 10 of C.P.C. is however, limited by its language to be of application only to 'suits ' pending in courts.
16. Section 33 of the Act prescribes the powers of the Commission in relation to its proceedings. The relevant portion is reproduced below for convenience:
Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, (Act XLV of 1860), and the Commission shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
17. The judicial nature of proceedings carried out by the Commission is therefore limited to the situations demarcated above. In all other situations, the Commission performs quasi-judicial functions and may not be deemed a 'Court ' for the purposes of section 10 of the C.P.C. Proceedings before the Commission are therefore not equivalent to suits before a civil court. Furthermore, the settled interpretation of section 10 of the C.P.C. provides that for the section to be applicable, the two suits must be pending before courts of competent jurisdiction. In Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Messrs Azeem Food Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. for example, it was held by the Sindh High Court that where proceedings are not in the nature of a civil suit and are instead special proceedings provided for under special law, the provisions of section 10 of the C.P.C. would not be attracted.
Apart from the above, no other mala fide has been alleged by the Respondents. It is a settled principle of law that mala fide is to be proved through independent and cogent evidence, mere allegation are not sufficient. For the foregoing we place reliance on the case of Zulfiqar Ali v. Province of Punjab, reported as 2018 PLC (C.S) 842. In addition to the foregoing, we also refer to the case of Shafi Mohammad v. State, reported as 2017 YLR 317, wherein it was held that the burden of proof is on the one who alleges mala fide on part of Complainant or the investigation agency.
The issue in this case is the deceptive use of the Complainant's registered collective marks by the Respondents and of its project name i.e; Tarbiyah by Respondents without prior authorization. In this context, whether the information that ultimately reached the consumer is false or misleading and has the capacity to harm the business interests of the complainant under sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b), respectively and whether the Respondents are fraudulently using Complainant's trademark under section 10(2)(d).
","In terms of the above, the SCN is hereby disposed of.

ITALFARMACO S.P.A.---Petitioner
Versus
HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","C.O. No. 751 of 2010, decided on 17th May, 2017.",,,"An application under section 90(1)(b)(i) and section 80(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance"") has been filed by the applicant-company Italfarmaco S.P.A, a company existing under the laws of Italy through its authorized signatory (""the applicant""). The application has been filed for a declaration of invalidity of the entry in the Trademark Register of the trademark FERPLEX registered under No.130807 dated July 11, 1995 in class 5 for pharmaceutical preparations used as iron supplement. The trademark FERPLEX (""the trademark"") has been registered in the name of the respondent No.1 Himont Pharmaceuticals (""Himont"").
A license agreement dated 26.10.1994 was executed between the applicant and Himont regarding the manufacturing and sale of the trademark. The agreement is annexed with the application. The primary facts which form the foundation of the application are not in dispute between the parties and the parties are on common ground with regard thereto. Thus, the registration of the trademark in the name of Himont since the year 1996 was within the knowledge of the applicant and the position continued to subsist until the filing of the application for declaring the trademark as invalid. The license agreement between the parties was terminated by the applicant vide termination letter dated 27.4.2009.
It can be seen from a reading of the prayer clause of the suit filed by Himont that the suit seeks a declaration ""regarding the trademark FERPLEX"". The suit by Himont also seeks a declaration to the effect that exclusive agreement between the applicant and Himont is still valid and enforceable as also that Himont has the sole right to manufacture, market, supply, distribute and sale of the product FERPLEX in Pakistan. On 6.9.2010, the applicant also filed a suit before the District Court, Lahore under the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by the Ordinance. The suit by the applicant is for the grant of permanent injunction seeking to restrain Himont purportedly from infringing and using the trademark FERPLEX. Therefore, the suit by the applicant is also with regard to the trademark which is the subject matter of this application as well. It would be expedient to reproduce the prayer made in the suit by the applicant, which is as follow:-
""This honourable Court may further be pleased to pass/grant/direct:
a) An order directing the Defendant to recall all the stocks of its products from the market being sold under the imitated trademark FERPLEX as well as for destruction or replacement of the labels, plates, markings thereof along with destruction or handing over to the plaintiff for destruction of all the offending labels, plates, markings and other printed material bearing the imitated trademark FERPLEX.
b) To remove all figures, hoarding, boards, neon signs etc., bearing imitated trademark FERPLEX.
c) An order directing the Defendant to get all its Marketing Approval/Drug Registration for imitated trademark FERPLEX transferred to the name of the plaintiff.
d) Any other relief that this honourable Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the present case.""
Once again, it is evident from the prayer reproduced above that the injunction has been sought with regard to the trademark FERPLEX and ancillary reliefs have been asked for which inter alia include an order directing the defendant to have all its marketing approval/drug registration transferred to the name of the applicant. with new evidence presented.","It is correct that Himont was a licensee of the applicant under a license agreement executed on 26.10.1994. The agreement has effectively been terminated w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Himont alleges that the agreement could not be terminated and has brought a suit before the District Court, Lahore. The parties are at variance with regard to the fact whether the agreement gave the power to Himont to have the trademark registered in its name. The parties are poles apart on the interpretation put on the different clauses of the license agreement with regard to this aspect. The applicant asserts that by the license agreement, Himont was merely conferred a license for the use of trademark FERPLEX within the territory of Pakistan. The applicant provided requisite data and information to Himont to enable it to obtain marketing approval/drug registration under the trademark FERPLEX and based on the information and data provided by the applicant, Himont succeeded in obtaining market registration from the applicant for formulating, manufacturing and selling the FERPLEX products as licensee of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the trademark was registered with the Registrar of Trademark in the name of Himont and the current application has been made by the applicant to declare as invalid the registration of the trademark."," In view of the above, C.M No.1-C of 2011 is allowed. The application is hereby returned to the applicant to be filed before the appropriate forum.
","Two grounds form the nub of the applicant's arguments with regard to the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by Himont. These grounds revolve around the true construction of provisions of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. Firstly, the learned counsel states that in fact no proceedings are pending with the District Court within the contemplation of the term as used in subsection (4) and thus, the exception to subsection (4) is not attracted so as to convince this Court to allow the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. Secondly, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the purposive construction of subsection (4) was that the choice to approach the appellate forum was retained by the applicant who brings an application under section 80 for seeking a declaration of invalidity with regard to a trademark.
the application may be made by an interested party either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thus far, the choice lies with an interested party to file an application either to the Registrar or to the High Court or a District Court. Thereafter follows an exception which has been provided in subsection (4). In terms of that exception if the proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court the application shall be made to the High Court or a District Court. The learned counsel for the applicant laid great stress on the aspect that the proceedings before the District Court were not proceedings within the ambit of the term as used in clause 'a' of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance. This submission of the learned counsel is nuanced and has no legal legs to stand upon. The term 'proceedings' is a compendious term and includes all or any causes which are brought before the courts and on which the courts can undertake judicial proceedings. It would suffice to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as the State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) for an elaboration to the term 'proceedings'. It was held that:-
""Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, interpretation of the word 'proceeding' as interpreted in various pronouncements given above, we are of the opinion that the word 'proceedings' is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" means the instituting or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a 'proceeding' is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or judicial officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an action.""
The learned counsel for the applicant attempted to make a subtle distinction on an issue which arises peripherally from the first submission made by the learned counsel with regard to the meaning of the term 'proceedings'. He stated that the proceedings before the District Court were not regarding the use of the trademark but merely sought the cancellation of the registration of the drug with the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan. n order to understand the proposition raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, the prayers made in the suits filed by the parties before the District Court, Lahore have been brought forth above. In this application, the prayer is to the effect that the trademark registration be declared as invalid in terms of section 90(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and in the alternate it has been prayed that registration of trademarks be rectified by substituting the name of the applicant as the proprietor of the registered trademark. Therefore, the entire prayer of the applicant constitutes a request for a declaration of invalidity with regard to the trademark registered in the name of Himont. If we were to juxtapose the prayers made in this application with the one made by Himont in its suit before District Court, Lahore it would become evident that Himont has prayed for the converse of what the applicant has prayed in the instant application. 
It is under these circumstances that inter alia a declaration has been sought in the suit for the continued use of the trademark FERPLEX by Himont as also for a declaration that any use of the trademark FERPLEX by any party including the defendant shall be an act of unfair competition and in violation of Himont's commercial and equitable rights. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant or any of its agents from obstructing the business of Himont has also been sought. More importantly, a decree for permanent injunction has been sought restraining the applicant herein either directly or indirectly from using the trademark FERPLEX in Pakistan in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the relief claimed in the suit filed by Himont is in conflict and directly contrary to what has been asked for in the present application. 
The learned counsel for the applicant made a reference to section 72 of the Trademark Act, 1940 and referred to the words ""as the case may be"" as used in section 72 of the Act, 1940. He also referred to section 73 of the Ordinance, 2001 in which in subsection (4)(a) while making a similar exception the legislature has used the words ""as the case may be"". Precisely, the learned counsel invited this Court to hold that the absence of these words has left a choice with the applicant to make the application to either the High Court or the District Court. This argument by the learned counsel will virtually have the effect of nullifying the intention of the legislature in providing an exception and will make the entire exception as redundant. It is trite principle and a rule of construction that redundancy cannot be attached to any provisions enacted by the legislature. If the argument of the learned counsel were to be accepted, this will mean that the application may be filed with the High Court or a District Court irrespective of the proceedings pending in the High Court or a District Court. This will have the unholy effect of making a mockery of the law and, therefore, such an interpretation could not be countenanced.
The wrongness of the argument is also evident from a consideration of the provisions of section 73 of the Ordinance. Section 73, so far as relevant, reads as under:-
73(4) An application for revocation may be made by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-
a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in case the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Subsection (4) confers the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for revocation on the Registrar. Thus, and it requires to be reemphasized, the power vests in the Registrar and nor in either the High Court or the District Court. 
The exception is couched in broad terms. The words ""if proceedings concerning the trademark in question are pending in the High Court or, the District Court "" evince a broad-based and wide-ranging concept which is inclusive. From the meaning of the term 'proceedings' brought out in the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, there is no doubt that it embraces within it the suits filed by the parties before the District Court and the current application too. But the key word in any opinion is 'concerning'. It connotes all or any proceedings even remotely touching upon the trademark in question. The word renders the entire concept fluid and plastic without being hedged in, in any manner. If the proceedings are brought under the provisions of the Ordinance, they are necessarily proceedings concerning trademark, whether they arise out of a contact or are brought for revocation of registration or for declaring as invalid the registration of a trademark. In this case, Himont resists the application for invalidity, tooth and nail. It seeks both the license agreement and the registration to be declared as valid in the suit before the District Court. The applicant says that retention of the registration of trademark is not a specific prayer in the suit filed by Himont. That may be so but the effect of declaring the license agreement to be subsisting and valid would have the consequence of impacting the question of registration too and there is no escape from it. The use of the word 'shall' too lends actuality to the analysis and clearly brings forth the mandatory nature of the provision.
As if this was not enough, the legislature enacted section 116 to reinforce the purpose of bringing in the exception in subsection (4) of section 80. Section 116 is to the following effect:-
""116. Procedure in certain cases of option to apply to the High Court, a District Court or the Registrar- Where under this Ordinance, an applicant has the option of making an application either to the High Court or a District Court or to the Registrar-
a) if any suit or proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending before the High Court or a District Court, the application shall be made to the High Court or, as the case may be, the District Court; and
b) in any other case, if the application is made to the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court or a District Court.
Once again, section 116 conceptualises the same statutory enterprise and is an overarching provision which applies to all applications made under the Ordinance. It seeks to attain the same end, that is, all decisions concerning a trademark should be consistent and made by the same forum.
The learned counsel for the applicant relied upon Jewan and 7 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1994 SCMR 826), Rafiuddin v. Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 2 others (1994 MLD 874) and Iqbal Begum v. Farooq Inayat and others (PLD 1993 Lahore 183). These judgments elaborate upon the concept and contours of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary to allude to these precedents as the concept is very well settled and the issue regarding the applicability or otherwise of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. does not arise as it is not denied that in these proceedings the general provisions of civil procedure apply and in case this Court comes to the conclusion that the present proceedings are caught by the mischief of subsection (4) of section 80 of the Ordinance, this Court has the power to make necessary directions in order to give effect to those provisions and there is no cavil with this proposition.
The learned counsel for Himont referred to Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer v. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833) which was a case concerning application under section 73 of the Ordinance for the revocation of the trademark. It was held in this judgment that the application ought to be filed with the Registrar and the only exception which allows the filing of such an application before the High Court if proceedings were already pending with the High Court. This precedent can be cited as a complete answer to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has a choice to file the proceedings either before the High Court or before the District Court. Messrs H & B, General Trading Company through Director v. Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028) is a Division Bench judgment of the Karachi High Court which held that proceedings under sections 73 and 80 of the Ordinance require such proceedings to be filed before the forum where proceedings concerning the trademark is already pending. This judgment is on all fours with the facts in the instant application and primarily supports the findings rendered in the instant application. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that all such proceedings must be decided by the same forum and this was based on sound principles of administration of justice and judicial governance and proceeded thereafter to return the application to be filed at the proper forum. The appeal before the Division Bench arose out of a judgment of the Single Bench of the Karachi High Court reported as 2009 CLC 354 which substantially arrived at the same conclusion which was affirmed by the Division Bench.",KMZ/I-18/L Order accordingly.,Order accordingly

(Against the judgment dated 26.02.2021 of the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad passed in F.A.O. No. 57 of 2020)
","8th November, 2021.","MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.","It was averred that the petitioner and respondent No.1 entered into a partnership agreement to conduct business of promoting, developing and managing international franchises. A partnership firm was thus formed and registered by the name of Zakori International (""Zakori International""). Zakori International is currently operating two successful brands in Pakistan namely ""Mr. COD"" and ""RANCHERS"". ""RANCHERS"", being an indigenous brand of Zakori International, the trademark ""Ranchers"" has been registered under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (""the Ordinance 2001""), in the joint name of the partners, being the petitioner and respondent No.1. It is further stated that under and in terms of a franchise agreement dated 13.10.2015, Zakori International granted to Messrs Royal Manor a limited license and franchise for operating a ""Ranchers"" Restaurant in Sector 1-8 (Markaz), Islamabad. However the respondent No.1, without the consent of the petitioner, entered, on behalf of Zakori International, into a tripartite Joint Venture Agreement (""JVA"") with Messrs Royal Manor, and one Afnan Shareef, the Respondent No.2, whereby Royal Manor agreed to take respondent No.2, as its joint venture partner in respect of the franchise restaurants operated by it under the name and style of ""Ranchers"", whereas Zakori International in terms of the said JVA, purportedly undertook to grant master franchising rights regarding ""Ranchers"" to respondent No.2. The petitioner contended that Zakori International could not have participated in the aforesaid JVA without the consent of the petitioner. It was further contended that by having agreed to extend to respondent No.2, the right of master franchising ""Ranchers"" unilaterally, and without the consent of the petitioner, the respondent No.2 has clearly infringed the registered trade mark, jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, against the clear restriction imposed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001. In addition to the above, according to the petitioner, respondent Nos.1 and 2, have incorporated a Private Limited Company by the name of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3, mainly for the same business as is being conducted by Zakori International under its trade mark ""Ranchers"". It was contended that the use of the trade mark/name, ""Ranchers"", by respondent No.3 company, will create an impression and lead to a belief that the entity is not different from, ""Ranchers"" jointly owned by the petitioner and respondent No.1, and such would ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"". with a different defendant.","The first grievance of the petitioner that emerges from the plain reading of the plaint, and as noted earlier, is that though the petitioner and respondent No.1 are the co-owners of the registered trade mark ""Ranchers"" and the partnership agreement between the two does not authorize any of them to grant a license to the use of the said trade mark, or assign or charge each other's share therein, and exactly to the same effect is the restriction placed by subsection (5) of section 24 of the Ordinance 2001, however the respondent No.1 without the petitioner's consent granted master franchise rights in respect of the subject trade mark to respondent No.2, which is clearly violative of the above provision and thus in terms of subsection (6) of section 24 of the said Ordinance, which clearly entitles the aggrieved co-proprietor to initiate infringement proceedings in such an eventuality, the petitioner was/is fully competent to institute the proceedings as he did.
7. The other grievance as set out in the plaint is that the respondent No.1 and respondent No.2, along with two others have incorporated a private limited company by the name and style of ""Ranchers Cafe (Pvt.) Ltd."", the respondent No.3. It is contended that the name of the company conspicuously bearing the name ""Ranchers"" whose principal line of business is the same as that being conducted by the Zakori International under the trade mark/name ""Ranchers"" would lead a consumer into believing that the respondent No.3 company is associated with the ""Ranchers"" brand owned by Zakori International, and thus using the name ""Ranchers"" as above is a clear infringement of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" as described/explained by section 40 of the Ordinance 2001, in terms whereof a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses, in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or deceitfully similar thereto, in relation to similar goods or services for which the same is registered, whereas subsection (5) of section 40 holds unauthorized use of a registered trade mark as one's own trade name or part of his trade name, as an infringement of the trade mark, and this is what exactly is being complained of by the petitioner.
","In view of the forgoing we convert this petition into an appeal and allow the same, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the tribunal to proceed therewith in accordance with law.","Although, as noted above, the respondents' acts and conduct as alleged by the petitioner clearly falls under sections 24 and 40 of the Ordinance, 2001 respectively, but for the sake of clarity we may observe here that use of trade mark can also be attributed to the person who has got to the stage where he can be seen objectively to have committed himself to use the mark that is to carrying his intention to use the mark into effect. Use of trade mark can therefore be demonstrated also through the intention to offer the goods and services and/or services, which are manifested through preparatory steps which show an objective commitment to using the trade mark, whereas in the instant case the respondents, in addition to having violated specific provisions of Ordinance, 2001, have also gone beyond the preparatory steps. We wonder as to where from the question of so called physical use arose.
Keeping in view certain observations found in the judgments of the fora below, we feel that a clear exposition with regard to the concept of passing off would be beneficial, and it would be appropriate to reproduce the concept as enunciated in Harvard's Law Review, Volume 68 (1954-1955) on the subject of development in the law.
Whereas though in the instant case, the petitioner contended that use of ""Ranchers"", as part of the company's name ""amount to passing off the trade mark registered in the name of the Zakori International"", however, as noted earlier, has in fact alleged violation of specific restriction imposed by two separate provisions of Ordinance 2001, which are clearly based on infringement of petitioner's trade mark, within the meaning of the said two provisions.
It may also be relevant to note that what is described as a passing off action may either be a passing off action simplicitor or an action of infringement of trade mark coupled with passing off. Where the case of passing off action is based on infringement of trade mark, such suit shall necessarily require determination of the question whether there had been any infringement of the trade mark and where infringement of trade mark is alleged the suit must, in view of sections 17, 18 and 39 of the IPO Act, 2012, be instituted before the tribunal notwithstanding that the allegations in the suit were coupled with the allegation of passing off.

Raja ASIR MUNIR and another---Appellants
Versus
Messrs DHL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED and 2 others---Respondents

","Appeals Nos. 1 and 2 of 2013, decided on 23rd May, 2017.",,"AHMED OWAIS PIRZADA, MEMBER TECHNICAL.","Briefly the background of the appeals is that the Competition Commission of Pakistan received a complaint from respondent No. 1, alleging fraudulent use of its stylized and artistically created logo trademark by the appellants without any permission or authorization or consent of the respondent, which being false, deceptive and misleading and also capable of harming its business was in violation to the provision of section 10 of the Act. The Commission conducted an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Act, concluding that both the appellants used the logo, which were identical in colour and style of the complainant's trademark on the bill board/hording/sign board for advertisement, which prima facie gave an impression that the appellants were authorized dealers of the complainant, which was not correct impression, hence such use of mark which was identical to the respondent's trademark, prima facie was misleading the consumer and was also capable of harming the business interest of the respondent in violation of section 10 of the Act. The report recommended that the conduct of the appellants warranted initiation of proceedings against them under section 30 of the Act.
3. Based on the prima facie findings of the inquiry report, show cause notices were issued to the appellants on 22nd February, 2012, pursuance to which appellants and all other parties were afforded an opportunity of a detailed hearing. Finally the Competition Commission of Pakistan concluded that the manner in which marks under question were printed and advertised look deceptively similar to that of respondent's trademark. Consequently the appellants were penalized vide order dated 21st December, 2012 which had been impugned in the instant appeals.
4. In their appeals the appellants stated that the impugned order dated 21st December, 2012, passed by Competition Commission of Pakistan was illegal, against the law and facts of the case on record and passed arbitrarily. It was stated that neither font, colour did have any resemblance with the respondent's trademark nor style has any similarity with the styled trademark of the respondent. It was further stated that the impugned order was without jurisdiction and not sustainable in the eyes of law. The appellants stated in their appeals that the inquiry report and even the order passed had failed to bear out any misleading information being passed by the appellants or any impression which was basically different from actual one, in clear term there was no deception in using the word IDHS international couriers. The appellants stated in their appeals that from the plain language of section 10(b) of the Competition Act, it was apparent that the lawmakers divided the allegation in to distribution of false or misleading information and distribution of information lacking a reasonable basis related to character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or quality of goods while in the instant case there is no distribution of any false or misleading information and no such information was passed on to the customers regarding the DHL World Wide Express, which affected the price, character, method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or concern the qualities of goods. The appellants took the position that the complaint was not properly instituted, signed and verified by the competent and authorized person. PLD 1971 Supreme Court page 550 was referred in this behalf. Further, the complaint, which was filed with wrong name of the appellant's company, was not having affidavit with it before the Competition Commission of Pakistan. It was stated that the appellants were neither using the trademark nor distributing false or misleading information regarding the fact that the appellants were authorized/permitted by the respondent. It was further stated that very important questions of law and facts were involved in the matter which could not be adjudicated upon without recording the evidence of both the parties. The pleadings were itself not evidence, it should be proved after recording evidence which was not brought on record.
5. Learned counsel for IDHS while reiterating the position taken in the appeal stated that ""IDHS international couriers"" was a trademark having trademark No-333053 and applied copy right registration with the concerned department. The trademark authority and the copy right authority under the relevant legislation has power upon the case where DHL World Wide Express registered its trademark and copyrights, therefore, the order in the given circumstances was without jurisdiction. Learned counsel further stated that the appellant never accepted, received, dispatched or delivered the goods with the name of respondent. The appellant never presented himself as agent, distributor or employee of the respondent. The learned counsel further stated that the appellant neither developed a web page, letter head, visiting cards, pamphlets, brushers, leaflets, booklets, e-mail ID by the name of respondent nor found in any correspondence or communications with the name of respondent with any third party. Thus the inquiry report, show cause notice and the subsequent order is without any basis lacking material evidence and liable to be set aside in the interest of justice.
 in a different city.","After completing the aforesaid exercise we are of the view that the following issues are to be examined for orders.
(i) Whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person?
(ii) Whether the Respondents have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general and in particular:
(a) are disseminating false/misleading information to the consumers lacking reasonable basis regarding inter alia in terms of clause (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act.
(b) are fraudulently using the trademark of the Complainant in violation of clause (d) of subsection (2) of section 10 and
(c) such practice is capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant in violation of clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act?
(iii) Whether the order of the Competition Commission is bad in the eyes of law.
","In the circumstances, after analyzing the relevant facts and material available on record, we have come to the conclusion that finding recorded by Competition Commission of Pakistan are based on proper appraisal of relevant provisions of Competition Law as well as other material brought on record. The same are, therefore, maintained.
The appeals of the appellants, therefore, being devoid of merits are dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

 
","The issue that whether the complaint was competently filed through a duly authorized person has thoroughly been examined by the Competition Commission of Pakistan, however since the same has again been raised by the appellants, therefore, we have also looked into it. The perusal of record reveals that Mr. Nouman Anwer Butt raised the issue that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, it was noted that the complaint was filed by the Company Secretary namely Mr. Muhammad Haneef Idrees, which was not only bearing the signatures but also beard the seal of the respondent's undertaking. A certified true copy of Board Resolution No. 12/2011 by circulation passed on 17th August, 2011 was also annexed with the complaint. In the said Board Resolution along with Company Secretary, Mr. Sarfaraz Sadiqui, Chief Executive Officer of the company was also authorized on behalf of company in the matter to take all necessary measures, required in this regard before the Competition Commission of Pakistan and all courts, arbitrators, Tribunal, Forum or Administrative Authority in relation to the said matter. 
Before examining the remaining issues including contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act, we would like to deal with certain objections raised by the respondents. The trademark authority and the copyright authority under the relevant legislation have the power upon the case where ""DHL World Wide Express"" registered its trademark and copy right, therefore, the impugned order in the given circumstances is without jurisdiction. The aforesaid issue has been examined and it has been observed that involvement of a person in violation of provisions of the Competition Act provides necessary jurisdiction to the Commission to take cognizance in such type of situation for necessary orders. In these circumstances, the objection raised by Raja Asir Munir is totally uncalled for and unjustified.
Now coming to the issue that whether the appellants have acted in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act in general or in particular, learned counsel for IDHS and DHIL have been asked to explain the logical reasoning and justification for adoption of marks IDHS and DHIL, however both of them could not give any justification which could be considered convincing to have mark almost identical to DHL. On the other hand a company was incorporated by three friends, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn having DHL as an essential part of company name and also used as a trademark. It is, therefore, observed that mark having resemblance with DHL is intentionally selected to confuse the market. Again the aforesaid logo has a lot of similarity with DHL.
As regards the contravention of the provision of the section 10 of the Act in general or particular, one needs to be conscious that the interpretation of fraudulent use of trademark has to be in the context of deceptive marketing and would thus have a broader scope. To analyze the provision of section 10 more conveniently the said section 10(2)(d) is reproduced as below:-
""fraudulent use of another's trademark, firm name and product labeling or packaging""
Coming to the third issue that whether the order of the Competition Commission of Pakistan is bad in the eyes of law being against the fact and passed arbitrarily. The appellants have failed to explain as to why and how the order passed by the Competition Commission could be illegal and how it is against the law and facts of the case and passed arbitrarily. Such statements without any cogent arguments and corroborative case law remain inconsequential to the appeals. Further the contention of the appellants that the Competition Commission has passed the order without having jurisdiction to do so is incorrect. It is observed that since the appellants have been involved in violation of the provisions of Competition Act, 2010, therefore, the Commission has the necessary jurisdiction and the case has been validly and competently filed and decided by the Commission.

Versus
REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS and another---Respondents
","M.A. No. 11 of 2006, decided on 11th November, 2019.","27th May, 2019.","SYED HASAN AZHAR RIZVI, J.","The brief facts of this case are that the appellant is a private limited company incorporated in Pakistan. The dispute involves ownership rights of trademark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan in respect to Class 16 of the international classification of goods. The parent organization of the appellant, Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO), introduced public survey and public opinions research in Pakistan. PIPO and its affiliate organization Gallup Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited and the appellant are the only members of Gallup International Association in Pakistan and are the exclusive users of trade mark GALLUP in Pakistan till to date. In 1981, PIPO became the exclusive Associate Member of Gallup International in Pakistan. In 1984, PIPO became the exclusive full member of Gallup International in Pakistan and PIPO and its affiliates have been consistently using the trademark GALLUP and Gallup Pakistan together with Pakistan Institute of Public Opinion since at least 1981. Gallup Pakistan has been existing for nearly forty years and has been the exclusive user of the trade mark ""GALLUP"" in Pakistan. The joint names of Gallup Pakistan and Gallup Organization in the International Gallup Directories illustrate that respondent No. 2 never claimed any right for use of name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan nor objected to the use of the said name by the appellant and its affiliates in Pakistan. Respondent No. 2 accepted throughout the right of Gallup Pakistan to use the name ""Gallup"" in Pakistan exclusively. The appellant on 07.5.1994 filed an Application No. 124363 for registration of its trademark ""GALLUP"" in Class 16 and the application was accepted for advertisement. Respondent No. 2 filed Opposition No. 56 of 1999 alleging that it was the proprietor of Trade Mark ""GALLUP"" and also disclosed pendency of its Application No. 129970 dated 02.5.1995 for registration of same mark in same class. Respondent No. 2 has failed to file a single document showing use of the name ""Gallup"" by them in Pakistan. The appellant filed a counter statement to the opposition along with documentary evidence and affidavit supporting such counter statement. Respondent No. 2 never filed any reply or rejoinder to the counter-statement of the appellant. The contents of the appellant's counter statement therefore remain un-rebutted till date. under different legal circumstances.","""Who is the proprietor of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan?""
""Whether use of the trademark 'Gallup' in Pakistan by the Appellant would entitle it to secure registration in its name?""
""Whether the adoption of the trademark 'Gallup' by Applicant constitutes honest concurrent user?""","After taking into account evidence about the long history of the GIA, domestic courts in these and many other countries came to recognize that Respondent No. 2 is just a rich American corporation which is trying to unfairly bag the fruits of the labor of independent scholars from all over the world.""
""Therefore, the plea of the appellant that since presently the respondent No.1 is not dealing in 'tea-product' hence registration of its mark 'AHMAD LOAD TEA' shall cause no harm to respondent No.1 is misconceived.""
""As regard another plea of the appellant that since respondent No.1 has not objected/opposed to grant of mark 'AHMED' in class-30 to other entity 'AHMED TEA COMPANY, PESHAWAR' hence respondent No.1 cannot object / oppose the application of the appellant, it would suffice to say that such plea alone cannot prevail over the rights, created by section 29(4) of the Ordinance to every such application nor legally mere negligence in making proper opposition to some earlier application can be a ground to deprive the authorized user from those rights and privileges which are the creation of the law itself.""","Mr. Ijaz Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the impugned order has been passed without taking into consideration the fact that the appellant is the exclusive user of trademark ""Gallup"" in Pakistan, which is established by admitted documents. He has further argued that it is an established fact that the name of the appellant or its parent organization has appeared several times in Gallup International Directories along with and to the knowledge of respondent No.2. He has also argued that respondent No.2's use of this trademark anywhere else in the world is irrelevant as respondent No.2 has failed to prove any work carried out by them in Pakistan. He has urged that the entire project of Gallup Pakistan was started by Dr. Ijaz Shafi Gilani upon encouragement of Dr. Gallup since 1978. He has also urged that Dr. Gallup and scholars from their respective countries established ""The International Association of Public Opinions Institutes"" which was later converted into ""Gallup International Research Institutes and thereafter Gallup International Association was incorporated, which took over the business of Gallup International Research Institutes and Gallup International only makes one member in every country, these members also had the right to use the name ""Gallup"" in Dr. Gallup's own life time as well as afterwards. He has argued that the Appellant is honest, concurrent user in terms of international usage and reputation of the trademark ""Gallup"".
Learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the impugned order is a non-speaking order and does not contain any reasoning at all for arriving at the conclusion. It merely reproduces the contention of the parties and nothing more as the only discussion made by the Registrar does not contain any reasoning and completely ignores the evidence produced by the appellant. He has urged that Registrar has failed to mention a single document filed by the appellant. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed by completely ignoring the relevant facts and evidence. In this regard he made reference to Section 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1940 clearly states that disputed issues relating to title of a trademark cannot be decided without proper evidence.",MH/G-45/Sindh Appeal allowed.,Allowed

Messrs SHAUKAT SOAP AND GHEE INDUSTRIES (PVT.) LTD.---Appellant
 
Versus
 
Messrs SHAUKAT BROTHERS SOAP MANUFACTURERS (PVT.) LTD.---Respondent

"," 
F.A.O. No. 157 of 2015, decided on 27th May, 2015.",,,"This appeal under section 104 of the C.P.C. has been filed by Messrs Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") through its Chief Executive Mr. Habib Ahmad against the order dated 19.2.2015, passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala in Civil Suit No.2 of 2012 whereby application of the appellant filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction against Messrs Shaukat Brothers Soap Manufacturers (Pvt.) Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as ""the respondent"") has been dismissed.
The background of the case is that the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction against the respondent. Along with the suit it filed an application for temporary injunction. In the suit it was averred that the appellant's Trade Mark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" is registered under Registration Nos.25850 dated 30.6.1956 and 44332 (in Class 3) dated 8.11.1965 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Trade Mark""). The said Trade Mark registrations were originally obtained in the name of Abdul Ghani, Abdul Hamid, Manzoor Ahmed, Muhammad Siddique, Mushtaq Ahmed trading as Shaukat Soap Factory, Thanewala Bazar, Gujranwala. According to the extract of the certified copy of the registration No.44332, pursuant to a request for change of ownership on Form No. TM-24, on 15th August, 1979 Messrs Shaukat Soap Factory Ltd. having the same address was registered as the subsequent proprietor of the Trademark w.e.f. 9.8.1972. Based on the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company filed along with the suit it has been submitted that the company incorporated in the name of Shaukat Soap and Ghee Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., the appellant, has taken over the running business and concern carried out at Gujranwala in the name and style of Shaukat Soap Factory; that this subsequent merger is being recorded with the Trademarks Registry and the appellant claims that it is the true and bona fide owner of the aforesaid Trademark and that it has the exclusive right under the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 to use or authorize the use of the aforesaid Trademark.
The respondent on the other hand contested the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction by contending that the Trademark Registration Nos.25850 and 44332 for the registration of the words ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" are invalid as these words cannot be considered to be of a distinctive character under section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 and that the word ""SHAUKAT"" is a surname according to its ordinary significance; that the said word cannot be registered as a Trademark as it is free to be used by anyone who has the name Shaukat. The respondent further asserted that the Trademark ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" is a distinctive Trademark and sufficiently different from the Trademark ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" so there is no possibility of any confusion or deception in the market.
At the time of the decision of the application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. the above said factual background and information/material was available with the learned Additional District Judge. However, in her impugned judgment she has proceeded to decide the matter on the ground that there is very minor similarity between the trademarks ""SHAUKAT SOAP"" and ""CRYSTAL SHAUKAT"" as there is only a common usage of colour yellow by the respondents similar to those of the appellant on their wrapper in which the soap is packed. She has relied on the case law reported as Messrs Super Asia v. Anwar Industries (2007 CLD 1181) stating that it has been held in the said case that the trademark ""Asia"" and ""Super Asia"" were held to be different names and not confusingly similar. Lastly she has observed that both the parties are real brothers and since they have inherited the business, as such they have similar rights and claims on the basis of which it has been held in the impugned judgment that the appellant has failed to establish a good prima facie arguable case and, therefore, observed that there was no need to discuss other ingredients for the grant of temporary injunction under different legal circumstances.","The stance of learned counsel for the respondent that the trademark ""SHAUKAT"" is hit by section 6(1)(d) of the Trademarks Act, 1940 (which is similar in scope as section 14 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001) as such it was not registerable and thus a prima facie case is not made out in favour of the appellant, is not sustainable for the reason that section 43 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark the fact that a person is registered as a proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trademark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof, whereas section 44 ibid provides that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trademark, the original registration of the trademark shall, after five years from the date of its original registration, be taken to be valid in all respects unless the registration was obtained by fraud or unless it offends the provisions of section 14(3) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. 
A Court dealing with an application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. has to consider which of the parties has a prima facie case, balance of convenience or inconvenience and likely to suffer irreparable loss in case of grant or refusal of interim injunction.
The respondent has adopted SHAUKAT and has added the word CRYSTAL before it. Therefore, in essence the question is whether addition of a word to a registered trademark, and in this case which has been used for a long time, makes the two marks sufficiently different based on which there is no possibility of confusion or deception.
","In the circumstances, the impugned order is set-aside and the respondent is restrained from using the word ""SHAUKAT"" as a trademark either alone or along with the word ""CRYSTAL"" or in conjunction with any other word or device along with a wrapper of soap which is yellow and black in colour scheme, design and get up and depicts the portrait of their predecessor in the same place and position as that of the appellant till the decision of the main suit. It is, however, pointed out that no observation made by this Court in this order would be taken into account while deciding the main suit which would be decided on the basis of evidence recorded and the arguments of the parties at the relevant time. The instant appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms.
","During the course of arguments learned counsel for the respondent has failed to answer the query of this Court as to whether or not the claim of the respondent relates to a disputed business built around trademark SHAUKAT SOAP which they were also claiming through common usage or inheritance.
The law provides a proper mechanism and procedure for seeking revocation (section 73) and invalidity of registration (section 80) to an aggrieved party for redressal of its grievance, if it considers that a trademark in dispute was wrongfully registered by its proprietor. No such application/petition appears to have been filed by the respondent before the Court/Forum of Competent Jurisdiction. In the absence of filing of any such formal application, the argument of respondent to that effect cannot be considered. Also unless any act of fraud is prima facie floating on the surface of a trademark registration, the trademark registration, which is obtained after thorough examination and publication of notice in the Trademarks Journal for inviting public objections, must be considered to be validly registered and be enforced to provide certainty to its owner for protection of its registered rights.
The appellant company has exclusive right, reputation and good will therein. Where a party claims registration of a trademark which is valid, this would create a prima facie case in favour of the said party as has been observed in the case of Tabaq v. Tabaq (1987 SCMR 1090) and balance of convenience will also tilt in favour of the appellant/proprietor of the said trademark as infringement of its trademark affects its goodwill and reputation and will be likely to cause said party irreparable loss which cannot be compensated in monetary value. Therefore, the impugned order on this score alone is defective and illegal.
 It clearly provides in section 46(2) that in an action for infringement, all such reliefs by way of damages, injunctions and accounts can be availed by the proprietor of a trademark, and not as alternative to one another. Accordingly, it is apparent that the legislation has intended to clarify that where an injunction, damages and accounts all have been claimed together, an injunction would not be refused just because in addition to an injunction, damages and accounts have also been claimed. This aspect becomes further clear when repealed law namely Trademarks Act, 1940 is reviewed as no similar provisions were available therein, which are now available in the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. 
it appears from the said judgment that the reported cases referred to above namely, PLD 2000 Karachi 192, 1991 MLD 658, 1993 MLD 590 were neither referred nor considered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in arriving at the decision in the aforesaid case reported as Messrs Super Asia M.D. (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive v. Messrs Anwar Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and another (2007 CLD 1181). Thus in light of the aforesaid cases, and as appellant's trademark SHAUKAT is wholly incorporated in respondent's trademark, the addition of word Crystal is of no consequence and does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion and deception and just because the respondent has added the word Crystal before SHAUKAT does not make respondent's trademark CRYSTAL SHAUKAT sufficiently dissimilar to the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. 
 It is also the case of the appellant that the respondent is trying not only to infringe its trademark but has also adopted a colour scheme of the packaging/wrapper identical to that of the appellant on which the respondent is also using the portrait of a person similar to a portrait of one of the predecessors of the appellant.
In light of the prima facie facts available on record as well as the aforesaid binding judgments of the honourable Supreme Court, and also the judgments of the High Court, it prima facie appears that Respondent has dishonestly adopted the trademark SHAUKAT which is the registered trademark of Appellant. Respondent's addition of the word CRYSTAL before the word SHAUKAT to make it Crystal Shaukat has no bearing or consequences and does not protect it from being liable for infringement of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP. This is also as the public might assume that CRYSTAL SHAUKAT is yet another product of the same party which is selling products under the trademark SHAUKAT SOAP or is another quality or range of product and/or manufactured under permission or authorization of the owners of the registered trademark SHAUKAT SOAP, which is being sold in the Pakistani market for decades.","

","GHULAM AZAM QAMBRANI, J.","Brief facts necessary for adjudication of this appeal are that the appellant filed a suit for perpetual injunction against infringement of registered trade mark against the defendants contending therein that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 entered into a partnership agreement at Islamabad on 28.11.2013, forming a Firm in the name and style of ""Messrs Zakori International"" with its office at Murree Road, Rawalpindi; that the said Firm was duly registered with Registrar of Firms Rawalpindi under the partnership Act; that after establishing Messrs Zakori International, the appellant/plaintiff became busy in his other business ventures abroad. The appellant/plaintiff had to act as a dormant partner of Messrs Zakori International, hence he reposed his complete trust in respondent/defendant No.1 on the basis of family relationship and past association; that respondent No.1 was running all the day to day affairs of the Firm since beginning and all the record of business and accounts was in his control. However, as per business needs, the appellant/plaintiff used to inject capital in the business as required by respondent No.1; that bank account of Messrs Zakori International was also operated by respondent No.1, who was also having control over the business of Messrs Zakori International and the appellant/plaintiff had complete trust and confidence in him; that Messrs Zakori international is currently operating two successful brands i.e. Mr. COD with 22 branches across Pakistan, two in Afghanistan and one in Bahrain and Ranchers, an indigenous brand of Zakori International having two branches one in the Rawalpindi and the other in Islamabad; that trade mark Ranchers has been registered jointly in the name of respondent/defendant No.1 and the appellant/plaintiff under section 33(4) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 by the Registrar of Trade Mark vide No.401490 dated 06.11.2015, which means that all the Intellectual property rights relating to the Ranchers are vested in Zakori International, which in equal shares, is jointly owned by the appellant/plaintiff and respondent No.1; that despite the fact that the appellant and respondent No.1 were joint owners of the registered trade mark namely ""Ranchers"", respondent No.1 initiated the process of granting master franchising rights of Ranchers to respondent No.2 without obtaining prior consent from the appellant by executing a Joint ventures partnership agreement for Ranchers the J.V agreement was made on 01.04.2017, at Islamabad. The grievance of the appellant is that respondent No.1 without consent of the plaintiff and in violation of the partnership deed dated 28.11.2013, is executing joint venture partnership agreement of ""Ranchers"" with defendant No.2, through defendant No.3 in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001; that signing of the joint agreement by defendant No.1 with defendant No.2 without consent and approval of plaintiff constitutes infringement of registered trade mark of plaintiff within the meaning of section 40(5) read with section 46 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. with new evidence presented.",The main proposition falling for determination is as to whether the learned Tribunal has the jurisdiction or not.,"For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order does not call for any interference at this end, hence the appeal is devoid of any substance, therefore, the same is dismissed.","Here the question arises that whether mere usage of registered trademark belonging to a person by another person constitutes infringement and whether that usage need to be necessarily in the course of trade and whether usage of trade mark while executing any agreement constitutes infringement. The contention of the appellant side is that agreement between defendants Nos.1 and 2 has been executed in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, therefore, the same constitutes an infringement within the meaning of section 40(5) of the Ordinance, ibid, and accordingly the same is actionable under section 46(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001, meaning thereby that according to section 40 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, the defendant ought to physically use the trade mark of the plaintiff in the course of trade for constituting any infringement. In the instant case, the situation seems to be entirely different because the trade mark partially owned by the plaintiff has not been used, as yet, therefore, there is no question of infringement by the defendants in the course of trade.
10. A careful examination of the record reveals that the instant suit has been filed only on account of signing of an agreement between defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 and the stage of use of the trade mark has not yet reached. According to the contents of the plaint, defendant No.1, who is the joint owner of the trade mark ""Ranchers"" with the plaintiff is assigning the registered trade mark to defendant No.2 through an agreement dated 01.04.2017 without seeking the approval of plaintiff being the co-owner of the trade mark, in violation of section 24(5) of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The plaintiff while considering this action of defendant No.1 as an infringement of his registered trade mark has filed the instant suit. Thus the actual dispute is between co-owners of the trade mark and the plaintiff has filed the instant suit to restrain his co-owner i.e. defendant No.1 from entering into a franchise agreement of the trademark with defendant No.2. This Court has failed to find any express provision in the Trade Marks Ordinance, which prohibits a co-owner of a trade mark to enter into an agreement qua the subject trade mark with anyone else. Similarly, there is no provision in the Ordinance, ibid, which empowers a co-owner to file a suit against the other co-owner qua the issue of infringement. Similarly, there is no denial of the fact that any violation of section 24(5) read with section 69 of the Trade Marks Ordinance falls within the jurisdiction of a District Court under section 117 of the Trade Mark Ordinance and, as such, the Tribunal cannot adjudicate upon a controversy between the co-owners of the trade mark.
11. The next proposition, which boils down for determination is whether a dispute of partnership between the co-owners of a trade mark can be settled by the Tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction within the meaning of section 18 of the IPO Act. This court has carefully attended this aspect of the matter. Prior to the IPO Act 2012 all civil suits/proceedings regarding protection of intellectual property rights were filed before the District Judge under section 117 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001. The relevant Section of the Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 is reproduced hereunder in verbatim:-
""Suits for infringement to be instituted before District Court. No suit for the infringement of a trade mark or otherwise relating to any right in a trade mark shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.""

","Civil Appeal No.1356 of 1999, decided on 12th. August, 2004.
 
(On appeal from the order dated 1 10 1999 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore in F.A.O. No. 122 of 1999).",,,"Pepsi Cola Inc., a North Carolina Corporation, Executive Offices, 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577; U.S.A. (hereinafter to be referred to as Pepsi Cola Company) on 26th day of June, 1993, entered into an agreement captioned as Exclusive Bottling Appointment with Bolan Beverages (Pvt.) Limited, B 98/100, Quetta Industrial Estate, Quetta, Pakistan (hereinafter to be referred to as Bolan Bottlers). Through such agreement Pepsi Cola Company appointed Bolan Bottlers to bottle, sell and distribute their product known as and sold under the trademarks PEPSI COLA and PEPSI, solely within the limits of the Province of Balochistan described as ""Territory.""
 
The term of such appointment initially was for a period of five years commencing from the date of appointment. After the expiry of initial terms this appointment was to be automatically extended for additional terms of 5 years each unless either the Bolan Bottlers or the Pepsi Cola Company should give notice in writing to the other party of its intention not to renew the agreement or of the terms under which such appointment shall be renewed. Such notice was to be given at least one year in advance of the expiration of the original term of five years or of any additional term. Bolan Bottlers accepted the   appointment upon the terms contained in the agreement (pages 162 to 172) to bottle, sell and distribute the beverage only for ultimate resale to consumers within the ""territory"" and not without either directly or indirectly. Clause 2 of the agreement was incorporated to provide that Pepsi Cola Company will sell either directly or through its subsidiaries to Bolan Bottlers and the latter will purchase all units of Pepsi Cola concentrate required for the manufacture of the beverage known as Pepsi Cola the world over. A Unit of Pepsi Cola concentrate was of fixed quantity while the price thereof was US $ 1150.
 
Such bottling appointment issued on 26 6 1993 was intact when Pepsi Cola Company, vide letter dated 7 12 1998, cancelled the exclusive bottling appointment. On 16 12 1998, Bolan Bottlers filed a civil suit against Pepsi Cola Company and its various divisions for a declaration to the effect that the cancellation was void and unlawful and further that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and hence it could not be revoked unilaterally by Pepsi Cola Company. An injunction was also sought against Pepsi Cola Company to the effect, inter alia, that Bolan Bottlers be allowed to continue the business and Pepsi Cola Company be restrained from taking any action against the bottlers and under the Trade Marks Act, till the final decision of the suit. As the agreement stood already cancelled; we would better comprehend it to be a temporary mandatory injunction. In the alternative, Bolan Bottlers claimed a sum of Rs.985 million as damages with the assertion that the exclusive bottling appointment stood automatically renewed for another period of five years with effect from 26 6 1998.

The suit was strongly opposed by Pepsi Cola Company calling it to be counterblast to their suit before the High Court of Sindh and seriously alleging that Bolan Bottlers had been guilty of grave violation of terms of appointment and that under the terms thereof the cancellation was but unavoidable. The application filed by the plaintiff under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 read with section 151, C.P.C. was strongly resisted. The learned trial Court, vide its order dated 20 4 1999, allowed the application and granted all the interim reliefs contained in the application. Being aggrieved of the aforesaid order, Pepsi Cola Company filed F.A.O. No. 122 of 1999, whereupon an Hon'ble Single Judge of Lahore High Court recalled the interim injunction through order dated 11 10 1999 and hence Bolan Bottlers filed a petition for leave to appeal, which was granted by this Court on 20 10 1999 to consider various aspects of the case specially that the High Court while recalling the interim injunction, whether or not had complied with the law laid down by this Court in Muhammad Aref Effendi v. Egypt Air 1980 SCMR 588, and whether an injunction in such like cases can be granted, even, when the plaintiff has laid down substantial money claim in shape of damages.
 

 under unusual conditions.","Mr. Tariq Mehmood, learned counsel for the appellant while describing the agreement between the parties as ""franchise"" based his case on three fold grounds. Firstly, that an interest of Bolan Bottlers had been created in the franchise and therefore, the contract could not be revoked unilaterally under section 202 of the Contract Act. Secondly, that the grounds of cancellation were frivolous and no notice of revocation had been issued. Thirdly, that the duration of agreement had stood automatically extended to ten years before which the cancellation could not be made. A judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No.518 of 1994 (Beecham's case) decided on 7 8 2000 was placed reliance upon. A perusal of the judgment would indicate that the point of law settled therein was, as to, whether clause 12 of the agreement was governed by clause 13 of the agreement or vice versa. The case was argued from another angle as well. Learned counsel for the respondent Company laid sufficient stress on the fact that the Company has already revoked the agreement and stopped the sale of concentrate to Bolan Bottlers. That if any temporary injunction is granted now in their favour, it would amount to a mandate whereby such revoked contract would be trusted upon the respondent. . Our attention has been invited to another important aspect of the case not adequately rebutted by the opposite side. Learned counsel for the respondent has referred to various tests conducted qua the product sold in the market. It was put to four different tests whereafter it transpired that the Bottlers have been using the concentrate of `RC Cola' and were selling it under the name, style and trademark of `Pepsi Cola'. This is alleged to be a serious violation of the trademark in selling a product available for half the price of Pepsi Cola. 
Learned counsel for the appellant seriously objected to the manner in which various samples of the product were procured and sent to the laboratory. He was of the view that a spurious product in the market could have been manufactured by any other violator of the trade mark in the market and hence the availability of a spurious Pepsi Cola cannot be an exclusive prove of the fact that it was produced by Bolan Bottlers. ","Consequent upon what has been discussed above, there being no merit in the appeal, it is hereby dismissed, the order of the High Court is maintained and the temporary injunction prayed for by the appellant/ plaintiff is hereby refused.
 

 
","As franchise is not defined in our own Contract Act, we may have a reference to Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition page 658, where franchise is defined as ""a privilege granted or sold, such as to use a name or to sell products or service. The right given by a manufacturer or supplier to a retailer to use his product and name on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon."" In its simplest terms, a franchise is a licence from owner of trademark or trade-name permitting another to sell a product or to serve under that name or mark. Precisely this definition is more akin to a licence rather than an agency. What exists between the present parties is more suitable to be determined in the light of the agreement itself and then the relevant laws on the subject.
 
From the perusal of the agreement in question dated 26 6 1993 (pages 162 to 172) it would be clear that the very heading given to the agreement was neither licence nor agency but it was captioned as ""Exclusive Bottling Appointment"". Though the headings or the captions cannot exclusively determine the nature of a contract yet the various clauses thereof would be material in determining the real nature of the agreement. It would not be convenient to reproduce the entire agreement yet the material clauses thereof would be referred to at the appropriate places. Clause 2 defines the role of the parties where Bolan Bottlers is a purchaser of Pepsi Cola concentrate while  Pepsi Cola Company is the seller thereof. Clause 3 of the agreement further lays down that the trademark shall be the exclusive property of Pepsi Cola Company not subject to question by the Bottler. The seller shall protect the trademark and shall not be liable to the Bottler for any loss or damage suffered by Bottler's use of the trademark. This indicates beyond doubt that in this agreement the Bolan Bottlers would have no right or interest in the trademark or in the registration thereof or any designs, copy rights, patents etc. mentioned above.
Section 211 of the Contract Act describes the agent's duty in conducting the principal's business. Whether the business agreed upon between the parties before us is the one of the principal or of the agent remains to be determined in the light of the agreement. According to the agreement, the entire business belongs to the Bolan Bottlers and not the Pepsi Cola Company. In terms of the provisions of section 182 and 211 of the Contract Act, we believe that, prima facie, the agreement between the parties does not constitute an agency either. In the instant case Bolan Bottlers, as per agreement, is not bound to render any account to Pepsi Cola Company on demand. Section 216 of the Contract Act explains the principal's right to benefit gained by agent dealing on his own account in business of agency. Sections 217 and 218 of the Contract Act also lay down certain conditions that the agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account. In case before us, the Bolan Bottlers never received from the third persons any amount or account on behalf of or for the Pepsi Cola Company. The agreement viewed in the light of the text law, prima facie, indicates the existence of no agency.

We hold in the light of the above discussion, that an agent is a hyphen that joins and a buckle that binds the relation between the principal and the third party. Where a person is not liable to the principal for the submission of accounts such person cannot be dubbed as agent. In the instant case, the product known as Pepsi Cola is sold to the third party as the  property of Bolan Bottlers without any control of Pepsi Cola Company and hence it prima facie lacks the necessary ingredients of an agency. The Bolan Bottlers also do not receive any commission for the sale, rather, they receive the entire amount of sale consideration as well as the profits. 
The first portion of the section is clearly indicative of the fact that either the agent must have an interest pre existing in the property or creation of such interest should be the direct result of the agreement itself. In the instant case, the interest of the parties is only to the extent of sale by one and purchase by the other. Everything comes to an end the moment the sale is completed. The case of the appellant is that after such agreement the Bolan Bottlers constructed offices, employed numerous persons and hence a clear interest was created. This, we are afraid, all the infrastructure which has been constructed and prepared by the appellant is for the promotion of his own business which he commenced in order only to earn his own profits which are never to be shared by the respondent i.e. the Pepsi Cola Company.
After having gone through the law on the subject, we are of the view that only that agency is irrevocable which is created with adequate consideration and is designed to serve as security for some interest of the agent. Any expenditure in setting up office and necessary infrastructure for carrying on business of agency does not tantamount to the creation of interest of agent in the subject matter. To elaborate, we may mention that creation of tenancy or the grant of lease is tantamount to the creation of agency because a tenant or lessee by virtue of the very agreement of lease or tenancy becomes directly interested in the subject matter of lease etc. The interest of a person is created only where the authority is given for the purpose of being a security or is a part of the security and not to cases where such authority is independent and the interest of donee is created afterwards and incidental to the factum of sale etc. An act, of sale of consumer goods does not create an authority coupled with interest. We hold in view of the law coupled with the terms of agreement before us that it does not create an interest of the purchaser by itself and hence prima facie the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted. 
We also believe and hold that in the circumstances of the present case and in the light of section 21(a) read with section 56(f) of the Specific Relief Act, the instant one is not a fit case for the grant of temporary injunction. 
In order to reinforce the argument the learned counsel referred us to .numerous pages of Papers Book V showing the graph of sale of Pepsi Cola concentrate having been purchased by Bolan Bottlers during previous years. This background of sale of concentrate has remained reasonable and constant during early years but for six months next before the institution of suit no concentrate has at all been purchased, whereas, the product is constantly being sold in the market. It is not known as to how could the product be marketed, if genuine, when no concentrate at all is purchased. The obvious conclusion, 'prima facie, would be that some spurious product is marketed and the same is accepted as well in few of dispatches on record. In these circumstances, if a temporary injunction is granted, what assurance would there be that no spurious or unhygienic material shall be sold during the existence of the injunction. It is a case where, by sale of spurious goods, a serious infringement of trademark is alleged along with the substandard quality thereof. All these matters are most likely to adversely affect the goodwill of the Pepsi Cola Company which is always considered to be irreparable. Taking all the ingredients for the issuance of a temporary injunction we believe at this stage that the provisions of section 202 of the Contract Act are not attracted and hence the appellant has no prima facie case. The irreparable loss in case of grant of injunction, in the circumstances, would be that of the Company and not the Bottlers'. While parting with this aspect of the case, we may remark that, so far as the trademark is concerned, the Bottler has neither claimed any interest therein nor could it be so claimed in view of the express provisions of the contract.
Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant claimed that the ad interim injunction, in the instant case is continuing for a long time since, 1999 and that it would not be in the interest of justice if the same is withdrawn now at this stage. This, in our view is a novel argument. When once the High Court had refused injunction, the case should either have been heard by this Court at the most earliest or ad interim injunction should have been made conditional to early hearing. The injunction was originally granted with direction that the case be heard at the earliest possible. In view of the important nature of the case, the magnitude of the stakes and the quantum of finances involved the continuation of ad interim injunction for such a long time, in the circumstances, was rather sad. The appellant should better be not allowed to benefit from a situation so created. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly argued in rebuttal that this contract was created in the gear 1993 and was terminated in the year 1998 but still, under the force of an ad interim injunction, the appellant is in complete enjoyment of the business not sanctioned and desired by the Pepsi Cola Company.",M.B.A/ B 13/S Appeal dismissed.,Dismissed

SHEZAN BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS (PVT.) LTD. and another---Respondents

","Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2003, decided on 19th May, 2018.","25th April and 4th May, 2018.","Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, J","This Misc. Appeal under section 76 of Trademarks Act, 1940 impugns an order of the Registrar of Trademarks passed in dealing with Opposition No.218/2001 while considering the application of the respondent, registered as No.100857/29. The order on the opposition releases the application from such opposition and proceeded it for registration subject to the conditions that the word ""Shezan"" shall always be used in collaboration with either Lahore Continental, Lahore Oriental or Lahore Bakery and will always be used within the territory of Lahore Division.
2. It is the time of the appellant that they entered into the agreement with one Shezan Lahore, which was a partnership firm at the relevant time having its partners as Ch. Riazuddin and Rao Muhammad Usman, which then, with the passage of time, has taken shape of Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited, respondent No. 1 herein. Thus, Shezan Lahore in fact is a predecessor in right of the respondent Shezan Bakers and Confectioners (Pvt.) Limited.
3. It is the case of the appellant that the agreement dated 19.02.1975 with their predecessor and the predecessor of respondent No.1 was in respect of two restaurants i.e. Shezan Continental at 46-Dingah Singh Building, and Shezan Oriental, 7-Dayal Singh Mansions, both at Shahrah-e-Qaid-e-Azam Lahore and a bakery to serve the above two restaurants for sale of their product. Appellant have attempted to argue that in terms of aforesaid agreement they have agreed to sell and the respondent No.1 has agreed to buy the goodwill of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery, which does not include the sale of word ""Shezan"" as trademark, either with or without logo.
 under different legal circumstances.","Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent cannot take shelter of subsection (2) of section 10 of 'Trademarks Act, 1940 as they were not concurrent user of the trademark in its actual perspective. Learned counsel for the appellant further relied upon Chapter 5 i.e. assignment and transmission of the Trademarks Act, 940 and relied upon section 29, which deals with the assignment and transmission of trademark, whether in connection with the goodwill of the business or not, and went on to argue that these two are different and distinct entities, as understood from the language of section 29, and since word 'Shezan' as trademark was never specifically assigned or transmitted, it could only be presumed that goodwill of the business of two restaurants and bakery, including the rights of trademark, was assigned under the aforesaid agreement. He has further relied upon the judgment of Additional CIT v. Kwality Frozen Foods from Indian jurisdiction of Mumbai Bench in IT Appeal No.5023 (Mum.) of 2001, which is an unreported matter, Noor Muhammad v. Civil Aviation Authority reported in 1987 CLC 393, Seven Up Company v. Deputy Registrar Trademark reported in 1937 MLD 91.
On the other hand learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has relied upon provisions of section 10(2) of Trademarks Act, 1940 and submitted that it is the honest concurrent use since 1975 that enabled the respondent No.1 to file application, referred above; before the Registrar Trademarks which was subjected to the opposition of the appellant and was disposed of in terms of the impugned order. She has attempted to argue that before 1975 the predecessor of the appellant and respondent were partners but without making an attempt to establish such relationship she relied upon the terms of the agreement dated 19.02.1975, which, per learned counsel, is sufficient to claim their concurrent use and entitlement for its registration under the law. In support of her contention, she has relied upon the case of Cluett, Peobody & Co. v. Assistant Registrar Trademark 1991 SCMR 921 which defines the concurrent use of trademark and the case of Tabaq Restaurant v. Tabaq Restaurant 1987 SCMR 1090. She further relied upon the judgment in the case of Levi and Volika of the Chancellery Division 1879 and the case of Crembux Limited of Chancellery Division 1928.
",Upshot of the above discussion is that the appellant has failed to make out a case calling to interfere in the impugned order as passed by the Registrar of Trademark hence the appeal is dismissed.,"The impugned decision concludes in paragraphs 14 and 15 that the respondent is using the trademark Shezan as a result of agreement of 1975 and there appears to be no moral, ethical and legal justification for the opposition of the appellant. It was further observed that the opponent/appellant had himself given the right to use the mark ""for consideration"" and the opposition to register the said mark is not tenable on account of continuous use since 1975 without any action on their part hence respondent No.1 stood qualified for the registration under section 10(2). The Registrar however restricted its use while dismissing the opposition and releasing the application of the respondent for its process of registration to two restaurants i.e. Continental and Oriental and Bakery, all of them situated within the territory of Lahore division.
In order to conclude as to whether along with goodwill the trademark ""Shezan"" was also passed on to respondent, the perusal of the terms of the agreement would be very material. In the first recital of the agreement, the company i.e. appellant stated to be carrying on business of hotel, restaurant and bakery in various towns of Pakistan including Lahore and then these three subject premises were described. In the second recital these three premises were claimed to be on rental and the respondent No.1 was given the obligation to deal with the issue of renewal of such leases. In the fifth recital of second page of the agreement, it is stated that on account of negotiations, the company i.e. appellant's predecessor has agreed to sell and the firm i.e respondent's predecessor has agreed to buy the ""goodwill"" of Shezan Continental, Shezan Oriental and Shezan Bakery at a price which was acknowledged by the appellant/their predecessor. In term of first recital of the third page it is stated that through a separate negotiation the firm/respondent had purchased from the company/appellant against consideration the machinery and air-conditioning etc.
The covenants of the agreement also provide right to continue the business of these two restaurants and bakery and at such other places where the firm/respondent may deem fit within the territorial limits of Lahore division only under the subject name and style i.e. Shezan. However, it restricts its use in any other manner whatsoever except provided above.
The word ""goodwill"" and ""trademark"" were attempted to be treated as blood relatives. I would go on to penetrate further that in the subject case goodwill of a premises or of a place or of a business would worth nothing in case the subject and the essence of that business is extracted. If for instance a restaurant is being run successfully, it is not only premises or the infrastructure or ambiance that carries the reputation; it is the name and brand that carries the reputation too which is non-extractable part of goodwill and that may contribute towards building of a reputation. If one excludes the name of any good restaurant then it will be left with no other asset except an immovable property. The interpretation of subsection (2) of section 10 of Trademarks Act, 1940, in view of the above, cannot he restricted to a simple concurrent use irrespective of any agreement. Use of trademark under the agreement is not only permissive use but conclusive rights were being delegated and hence the use is concurrent to the use of the inventor. The subject use thus would come within honest concurrent use under the circumstances described in the agreement. It is inconceivable that the appellant would enjoy the consideration of a rental premises if the right of trademark is excluded. Certainly the consideration was for a particular territory i.e. Lahore division which was taken care of by the Registrar.
20. Had it been a case of permissive use only the appellant would have claimed a royalty for continuous use of the word/trademark, which is not the case here. It only advances the case of the respondent that the sale of goodwill includes the sale of trademark subject to its use within the territory defined therein.

The Commission upon receipt of the Complaint initiated an enquiry under section 37(2) of the Act. The principle allegation in the Complaint was that the Respondent is disseminating false and misleading information to consumers through advertisements in various newspapers, claiming to be Testing Service Provider in the name and style of ""Sukkur Testing Service (STS)"", which graphically resembles to the Complainant as ""SIBA Testing Service (STS)"" and consequently damaging the Complainant's reputation, which is also capable of harming the business interest of the Complainant.
The SCN served to the Respondent was returned undelivered with the remarks of the courier ""Shifted"". The office of Registrar contacted the Respondent telephonically and directed to receive the SCN personally. The Respondent received the SCN and filed written reply on 10th February 2020.  under heightened security.","However based on the submissions raised by the Complainant and the Respondent, we deem it appropriate to address the following issue: Whether the Respondent has resorted to the deceptive marketing practices in violation of section 10 of the Act?","For the reasons discussed above and in line with our mandate to protect the consumers from anti-competitive behavior, including deceptive marketing practices, we hereby hold the subject conduct of the Respondent has violated provisions of section 10(1) of the Act read with section 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
38. We are cognizant of the fact that marketers traditionally focus on designing advertising campaigns and other promotional strategies to promote a brand name. However, with evolving consumer preferences and laws, presentation; trade dress have become just as essential for making products and services distinctive and for building brand recall. The cultural diversity of the Pakistan market makes a compelling case for the importance of product identification by packaging and visual impression. This has resulted in third parties creating lookalikes of popular products with similar packaging or offer services through similar logos in order to grab consumers' attention and generate demand for their own products/services in the market. In our considered view, the consumers are clearly susceptible and at a serious risk of falling prey to deceptive confusion pertaining to the origin and quality of the products, due to the striking similarity in the Complainant's logo and the logo used by the Respondent.
39. In the instant matter it is on record that the Respondent had only published one advertisement i.e. the Impugned Advertisement, the last date to file application thereof was 26th November 2018. Thereafter, no further advertisements were issued by the Respondent. The Complaint was filed on 28th January 2019 and in the Enquiry Report it is also acknowledged that no other advertisement was published by the Respondent. It is on the record that the proprietor of Respondent discontinued the business through Respondent. The Respondent after the hearing in the matter has also submitted its Bank statement for the period 27th June 2018 to 12th February 2020 titled Sukkur Testing Services (SMC-PVT) Limited at Habib Bank Branch G-10 Markaz, Islamabad. From examination of advertisement and bank statement it is evident the advertisement was published in the newspapers on November 2018 and the last date of forms submission of fee was 26th November 2018. The Respondent received the fee amounting to Rs. 50, 150, 250, 300 and 450 from students for seven different posts mentioned in the advertisement. Till 26th November 2018 its account balance was Rs. 556,140.00/, The Respondent has clarified that the amount of Rs. 500,000/- (Rupees Five Hundred Thousand Only) was returned to the Public Sector Organization and the Bank Statement shows the withdrawal of the said amount also. During the hearing the Respondent had also submitted that he is willing to comply with the directions and he will not indulge in any illegal practices in future. It is also relevant that Complainant though had claimed during the hearing that prospective consumers approached them, however, no evidence in this regard was produced before us. Further, even in the Complaint's paras (5) and (6) there is no mention that the prospective candidates approached them upon seeing the advertisement.
40. Keeping in view all the facts and circumstance of the matter in hand, there is no doubt regarding violation of the provisions of the Act, however, the approach of the representative of the Respondent needs to be appreciated as they cooperated throughout the proceedings and the Respondent discontinued the violation during the enquiry and never repeated that violation of the Act. In addition he also apologized and assured future compliance of the Act in letter and spirit. We, therefore, inclined to impose a token penalty of Rs. 250,000/- (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Only). However, given Respondent is directed to deposit the penalty with the Commission in two equal instalments within ninety (90) days from the date of this Order. The Respondent is also reprimanded that in future, the Commission will take a very strict view of any or all non-compliances or contraventions under the Act.
41. In terms of the above, the Show Cause Notice No. 01 of 2020 dated 17th January 2020 is hereby disposed of.
","The concept of Consumer vis- -vis section 10 of the Act: It is clear that under the Act, the Commission is mandated to protect the consumers from anti-competitive practices prohibited. One of such practice is deceptive marketing practices, which is aimed at the consumers to make a transactional decision, Hence, it is important to determine the consumer for the purpose of assessment under section 10 of the Act. 
The concept of False or Misleading information in the process of advertising/marketing: Subsequent to understanding and clarifying the concept of Consumer, we are of the considered opinion that, it must be understood, what constitutes 'false' or 'misleading' information in the process of advertising/marketing which evokes a violation of section 10 of the Act. 
Net General Impression of the Impugned Advertisement: The third and most important aspect in order to record our findings vis-a-vis the violation of prohibition contained in section 10 of the Act, is to gather the impression of the advertisement/marketing campaign impugned. The Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e. Order in the matter of China Mobile Pak Limited and Pakistan Telecom Mobile Limited reported as 2010 CLD 1478, has held that:
""...evaluate complete advertisement and make an opinion regarding deception [...] on the basis of net general impression conveyed by them and not an isolated script"".
Material Information: With reference to the materiality of the representation, reference can be made to the FTC Policy Statement on Deception dated 14.10.1983 appended to Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 174 (1984), wherein it is provided that the commission, omission, or practice must be a 'material' one which is likely to affect the consumer's conduct or decision with regard to a product or service. This was also endorsed by the Commission in one of its earlier Orders i.e., Order in the Matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Zone and Ufone reported as 2010 CLD 1478.
28. We take into account the overall net general impression of the Impugned Advertisement, we cannot ignore the fact that similar acronym used by the Respondent might confuse the Consumers/ prospective candidates about the goodwill and status of the Testing Service. Hence, we are of the opinion that the Respondent by using the similar acronym is in fact passing off its services and misleading the consumers about its association with the Complainant.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, using of similar acronym by the Respondent gives the Consumers an impression that either the Impugned Advertisement is issued by the Complainant or the Respondent is somehow associated or affiliated with the Complainant. Further, the word `Sukkur' also can confuse the consumers about the information disseminated through the Impugned Advertisement that the services being offered to attract prospective candidates are by the Complainant. In response we note that the Respondent has not provided any evidence which substantiate that the Respondent is associated with the Complainant. Further, the use of similar acronym and words Sukkur in the Impugned Advertisement seems to be a conscious attempt by the Respondent to capitalize on the goodwill and standing of the Complainant. Hence, we are of the considered view that in the instant matter a violation of section 10(1) read with sections 10(2)(b) is made out.
31. Fraudulent Use of Trademark: With reference to the fraudulent use of trademark, it is on the record that the Complainant had applied for registration of trademark in the name and style of ""SIBA Testing Services"" vide application dated 22nd February, 2019 i.e. even after filing the Complaint with the Commission. We are also conscious of the fact that the trademark is not registered in favour of any of the parties. Although the Complainant, from the material available on the record, is a prior user; however, the ownership is yet to be conferred by the Trademarks Registry under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
We are cognizant of the fact that the scope of proceedings under section 10 of the Act is restricted only to the extent of deceptive marketing practices. We are not conferred with the power by the legislature to determine the right to ownership of any undertakings vis- -vis the trademark. The assessment in terms of Section 10(2)(d) of the Act i.e. fraudulent use of another's trademark, can only be carried out where the ownership is granted or acquired under any law i.e. the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, a similar situation exists in the instant matter, as the trademark is not registered in the name of either party, hence, any findings vis-a-vis the ownership of the trademark would be beyond the scope of section 10 of the Act and would be construed as encroaching upon the domain of Trademark Registrar under the Trademarks Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, we are of the considered view that a violation of section 10(2)(d) of the Act cannot be proved in the instant matter.
. Information Capable of Harming the Business Interest of other undertakings: Now turning to section 10(2)(a) of the Act, according to which 'the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming the business interests of another undertaking' constitutes a deceptive marketing practice. We are guided by one of Commission's earlier Order i.e. Order dated 21st December, 2012 in the matter of Messrs DHL Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd, 2013 CLD 1014, wherein the Commission had observed that ""it is important to recognize that part of any business' identity is the goodwill it has established with consumers, while part of a product's identity is the reputation it has earned for quality and value"". We are also guide by, Order dated 17 March 2015 in the matter of M/S Jotun Pakistan (Pvt) Limited, 2015 CLD 1638, the Commission had held that ""To prove conduct under section 10(2)(a) of the Act, it is not necessary to show actual harm to competitors. It is sufficient to show the existence of a deceptive marketing practice that has the potential to harm the business interests of the competitors."" (emphasis added).
It is also pertinent to mention that in the event that there exists a contravention of section 10(1) of the Act read with 10(2)(b) or (c) or (d) of the Act, a concurrent violation of Section 10(2)(a) is also made out. The consequence of the distribution of information to the public that is false or misleading is that it is capable of harming the business interests of and resulting in fatal consequences for the competitors of the undertaking making such deceptive claims. It may also be clarified at this point that the scope of section 10(2)(a) is much wider and far reaching than the other sub-sections of section 10(2). It was observed by the Commission in its Order dated 08 February 2016 in the matter of Show Cause Notice issued to Messrs A. Rahim Foods {Private) Limited, 2016 CLD 1128, that ""While there are innumerable instances of misleading information that an undertaking may distribute to the targeted potential consumer and hence be culpable under section 10(2)(a), a contravention of section I0(2)(d) will almost in every circumstance lead to a consequent contravention of section 10(2)(a) of the Act, unless there exist exceptional circumstances in a particular case that warrant otherwise"". The same rationale is applicable to Section 10(2)(b) of the Act, as it is to section 10(2)(d) of the Act.

","C. R. No. 68-P of 2021, decided on 1st April, 2022.","1st April, 2022.","MUSARRAT HILALI, J.","Precisely the stated facts of the case as recapitulated from the available record are that the petitioner applied for renewal of agreement with Shell Pakistan and while the process was in progress when in the meanwhile, the Ministry of Industries and Production Department Explosive vide office order dated 06.04.2020 sealed the filling station. The sealing order issued by respondent No.2 was challenged before the learned Civil Judge, Peshawar, however, the same was returned to the petitioner under Order VII, Rule 10, C.P.C. for lack of jurisdiction. The appeal filed thereagainst was also dismissed by the learned Appellate Court which has been impugned herewith. under unusual conditions.","Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that there is no issue between the petitioner and the Shell Pakistan Limited rather the license to the petitioner was issued by OGRA which is valid up till 23.09.2022. He next contended that in case respondent No.6 is not willing to continue business with the petitioner, then petitioner has every right to enter with any other company/firm.","Accordingly, this civil revision petition is disposed of in the above terms.","As against that, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.6 while rebutting the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner stated that no doubt the petitioner has got every right to carry business of filling station by entering into agreement with any company of its choice, however, it shall not use the monogram of Shell Pakistan Limited on any of its display point.
No doubt under Article 18 of the Constitution, every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful trade or business, however, it does not allow unauthorized use of another's trade mark to capture consumer attention as using another's trade mark is much like posting a sign with another's trade mark in front of one's store just to confuse or deceive the buyer.
Since the petitioner has entered into agreement with Messrs 21C HTL for his business activities, therefore, petitioner is directed to remove all symbols/marks indicating or showing any resemblance or confusion with the monogram of Shell Pakistan Limited. Both the parties i.e. the petitioner and respondents Nos.5 and 6 have readily agreed to the conclusion arrived at by this Court. The petitioner may, however, approach a proper forum having jurisdiction for any other matter arising out of this civil revision as during the course of arguments no other issue except the one discussed above, has been raised by learned counsel for the petitioner. Consequently, the order of sealing dated 06.04.2020 is set aside subject to removal of bill boards and other signs/symbols creating any confusion with regard to the trade mark of Shell Pakistan.",SA/219/P Order accordingly.,Order accordingly
